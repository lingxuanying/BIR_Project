The majority of cleft surgery is elective, and as a result, almost all cleft surgery was suspended across the UK in March 2020 during the first national lockdown. The UK has centralised regional Cleft Services which all use the same agreed target-age standards for primary surgery including lip and palate repairs. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) response has caused a delay in carrying out procedures. The severity of this delay depends on the impact of COVID-19 on local trusts and R-value within that region. As the country goes through the second and third wave, the impact could be long lasting, and we aimed to quantify it so that the data could be used to guide service prioritisation in the NHS and help future workforce planning. METHODS: An online survey was designed based on the cleft quality dashboard indicators and circulated nationally to all nine cleft regions in the UK. The survey was divided into three main headings: * Duration of suspended cleft services * Quantification of the impact on delayed in surgery/services * Changes needed to restart surgery/services RESULTS: We obtained a 60% response rate with five completed surveys from five out of nine regions. All regions reported that they suspended their cleft services in March 2020 around the time of the first wave and the first national lockdown. There has been an impact on delayed surgical and clinical interventions for cleft patients. Regions were affected differently with some on an exponential waiting list growth projection, whereas other teams are on track to recover from the backlog within 7-22 weeks. There has been an impact on the allied health professionals' services within the cleft multidisciplinary team. The cleft nurses' 24-h reviews, Speech And Language Therapy (SALT), and psychology maintained service delivery in some format. Patient-facing services such as audiology and dentistry were significantly disrupted and continue to experience delays due to reduced capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Various regions have seen a varied impact from COVID-19 on their services, from all cleft regions there seems to be an impact on achieving surgery within the national target age. The adverse effect of the COVID-19 impact is unlikely to be known for a few years to come; however, the data are a useful guide when supporting the allocation of resources within the healthcare setting. A prospective long-term study is required to assess the impact of COVID-19 on cleft surgery, follow-up, assess access to allied health professional MDT clinics, and long-term complications."

2,JAMA network open,"Importance: A surge of COVID-19 occurred from March to June 2021, in New Delhi, India, linked to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out for health care workers (HCWs) starting in January 2021. Objective: To assess the incidence density of reinfection among a cohort of HCWs and estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virion vaccine BBV152 against reinfection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a retrospective cohort study among HCWs working at a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India. Exposures: Vaccination with 0, 1, or 2 doses of BBV152. Main Outcomes and Measures: The HCWs were categorized as fully vaccinated (with 2 doses and >/=15 days after the second dose), partially vaccinated (with 1 dose or 2 doses with <15 days after the second dose), or unvaccinated. The incidence density of COVID-19 reinfection per 100 person-years was computed, and events from March 3, 2020, to June 18, 2021, were included for analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated vaccine effectiveness (1 - adjusted HR) was reported. Results: Among 15244 HCWs who participated in the study, 4978 (32.7%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 36.6 (10.3) years, and 55.0% were male. The reinfection incidence density was 7.26 (95% CI: 6.09-8.66) per 100 person-years (124 HCWs [2.5%], total person follow-up period of 1696 person-years as time at risk). Fully vaccinated HCWs had lower risk of reinfection (HR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.08-0.23]), symptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.24]), and asymptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.05-0.53]) compared with unvaccinated HCWs. Accordingly, among the 3 vaccine categories, reinfection was observed in 60 of 472 (12.7%) of unvaccinated (incidence density, 18.05 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 14.02-23.25), 39 of 356 (11.0%) of partially vaccinated (incidence density 15.62 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 11.42-21.38), and 17 of 1089 (1.6%) fully vaccinated (incidence density 2.18 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.35-3.51) HCWs. The estimated effectiveness of BBV152 against reinfection was 86% (95% CI, 77%-92%); symptomatic reinfection, 87% (95% CI, 76%-93%); and asymptomatic reinfection, 84% (95% CI, 47%-95%) among fully vaccinated HCWs. Partial vaccination was not associated with reduced risk of reinfection. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that BBV152 was associated with protection against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule, when the predominant circulating variant was B.1.617.2."
3,PloS one,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes have often been sudden and massive. The study investigated the role SARS-CoV-2 virus spread in nearby population plays in introducing the disease in nursing homes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was carried out through modelling the occurrences of first cases in each of 943 nursing homes of Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes French Region over the first epidemic wave (March-July, 2020). The cumulative probabilities of COVID-19 outbreak in the nursing homes and those of hospitalization for the disease in the population were modelled in each of the twelve Departements of the Region over period March-July 2020. This allowed estimating the duration of the active outbreak period, the dates and heights of the peaks of outbreak probabilities in nursing homes, and the dates and heights of the peaks of hospitalization probabilities in the population. Spearman coefficient estimated the correlation between the two peak series. RESULTS: The cumulative proportion of nursing homes with COVID-19 outbreaks was 52% (490/943; range: 22-70% acc. Departement). The active outbreak period in the nursing homes lasted 11 to 21 days (acc. Departement) and ended before lockdown end. Spearman correlation between outbreak probability peaks in nursing homes and hospitalization probability peaks in the population (surrogate of the incidence peaks) was estimated at 0.71 (95% CI: [0.66; 0.78]). CONCLUSION: The modelling highlighted a strong correlation between the outbreak in nursing homes and the external pressure of the disease. It indicated that avoiding disease outbreaks in nursing homes requires a tight control of virus spread in the surrounding populations."

We examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-technical skills of operating room (OR) teams in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observers rated live operations using the Oxford NOTECHS system. Pre- and post-COVID observations were captured from November 2019 to January 2020 and from January 2021 to February 2021, respectively. Scores were compared using Schuirmann's Two One-Sided Test procedure. Multivariable linear regression was used to adjust for case mix. A 10% margin of equivalence was set a priori. RESULTS: Observers rated 159 cases: 75 pre-COVID and 84 post-COVID. There were significant differences between groups in surgical department and surgeon-reported case complexity (both P<0.001). Total NOTECHS scores increased post-COVID on raw analysis (36.1 vs 38.0, P<0.001) but remained within the margin of equivalence (90% CI 1.3 to 2.6, P<0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated a similar increase within the margin of equivalence (2.0, 90% CI 1.3 to 2.7). Teamwork and cooperation scores increased by 1.0 post-COVID (90% CI 0.8 to 1.3); all other subcomponent scores were equivalent. CONCLUSION: Non-technical skills before and after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic were equivalent but not equal. A small but statistically significant improvement post-COVID was driven by an increase in teamwork and cooperation skills. These findings may reflect an improvement in team cohesion, which has been observed in teams under duress in other settings such as the military. Future work should explore the effect of the pandemic on OR culture, team cohesion, and resilience."

6,Bioinformatics and biology insights,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections (COVID 19) is a progressive viral infection that has been investigated extensively. However, genetic features and molecular pathogenesis underlying remdesivir treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. Here, we used bioinformatics to investigate the candidate genes associated in the molecular pathogenesis of remdesivir-treated SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Methods: Expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing dataset (GSE149273) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in remdesivir-treated SARS-CoV-2 infection samples and nontreated SARS-CoV-2 infection samples with an adjusted P value of <.05 and a |log fold change| > 1.3 were first identified by limma in R software package. Next, pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these DEGs was performed. Then, the hub genes were identified by the NetworkAnalyzer plugin and the other bioinformatics approaches including protein-protein interaction network analysis, module analysis, target gene-miRNA regulatory network, and target gene-TF regulatory network. Finally, a receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed for diagnostic values associated with hub genes. Results: A total of 909 DEGs were identified, including 453 upregulated genes and 457 downregulated genes. As for the pathway and GO enrichment analysis, the upregulated genes were mainly linked with influenza A and defense response, whereas downregulated genes were mainly linked with drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 and reproductive process. In addition, 10 hub genes (VCAM1, IKBKE, STAT1, IL7R, ISG15, E2F1, ZBTB16, TFAP4, ATP6V1B1, and APBB1) were identified. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that hub genes (CIITA, HSPA6, MYD88, SOCS3, TNFRSF10A, ADH1A, CACNA2D2, DUSP9, FMO5, and PDE1A) had good diagnostic values. Conclusion: This study provided insights into the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-treated SARS-CoV-2 infection that might be useful in further investigations."
7,Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: COVID-positive outpatients may benefit from remote monitoring, but such a program often relies on smartphone apps. This may introduce racial and socio-economic barriers to participation. Offering multiple methods for participation may address these barriers. OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine associations of race and neighborhood disadvantage with patient retention in a monitoring program offering two participation methods. (2) To measure the association of the program with emergency department visits and hospital admissions. DESIGN: Retrospective propensity-matched cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-positive outpatients at a single university-affiliated healthcare system and propensity-matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: A home monitoring program providing daily symptom tracking via patient portal app or telephone calls. MAIN MEASURES: Among program enrollees, retention (until 14 days, symptom resolution, or hospital admission) by race and neighborhood disadvantage, with stratification by program arm. In enrollees versus matched controls, emergency department utilization and hospital admission within 30 days. KEY RESULTS: There were 7592 enrolled patients and 9710 matched controls. Black enrollees chose the telephone arm more frequently than White enrollees (68% versus 44%, p = 0.009), as did those from more versus less disadvantaged neighborhoods (59% versus 43%, p = 0.02). Retention was similar in Black enrollees and White enrollees (63% versus 62%, p = 0.76) and in more versus less disadvantaged neighborhoods (63% versus 62%, p = 0.44). When stratified by program arm, Black enrollees had lower retention than White enrollees in the app arm (49% versus 55%, p = 0.01), but not in the telephone arm (69% versus 71%, p = 0.12). Compared to controls, enrollees more frequently visited the emergency department (HR 1.71 [95% CI 1.56-1.87]) and were admitted to the hospital (HR 1.16 [95% CI 1.02-1.31]). CONCLUSIONS: In a COVID-19 remote patient monitoring program, Black enrollees preferentially selected, and had higher retention in, telephone- over app-based monitoring. As a result, overall retention was similar between races. Remote monitoring programs with multiple modes may reduce barriers to participation."
