0,GeroScience,"Platelet aggregation has been associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. In older patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, we aimed to investigate the association between aspirin use before admission and the risk of in-hospital all-cause mortality. We performed a retrospective international cohort study in five COVID-19 geriatric units in France and Switzerland. Among 1,357 consecutive hospitalized patients aged 75 or older and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, we included 1,072 with radiologically confirmed pneumonia. To adjust for confounders, a propensity score for treatment was created, and stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (SIPTW) was applied. To assess the association between aspirin use and in-hospital 30-day mortality, SIPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. Of the 1047 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and median age 86 years, 301 (28.7%) were taking aspirin treatment before admission. One hundred forty-seven (34.3%) patients who had taken aspirin died in hospital within 1 month vs 118 patients (30.7%) without aspirin. After SIPTW, aspirin treatment was not significantly associated with lower mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.10 [0.81-1.49], P = .52). Moreover, patients on aspirin had a longer hospital stay and were more frequently transferred to the intensive care unit. In a large multicenter cohort of older inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, aspirin use before admission did not appear to be associated with an improved prognosis."

3,Atherosclerosis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thrombosis is a major driver of adverse outcome and mortality in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hypercoagulability may be related to the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, which is mainly driven by interleukin (IL)-6. Plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels increase following IL-6 upregulation and Lp(a) has anti-fibrinolytic properties. This study investigated whether Lp(a) elevation may contribute to the pro-thrombotic state hallmarking COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Lp(a), IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured in 219 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed with linear mixed effects model. The baseline biomarkers and increases during admission were related to venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence and clinical outcomes in a Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Lp(a) levels increased significantly by a mean of 16.9 mg/dl in patients with COVID-19 during the first 21 days after admission. Serial Lp(a) measurements were available in 146 patients. In the top tertile of Lp(a) increase, 56.2% of COVID-19 patients experienced a VTE event compared to 18.4% in the lowest tertile (RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.61-5.81; p < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, IL-6 and CRP increase and number of measurements. Increases in IL-6 and CRP were not associated with VTE. Increase in Lp(a) was strongly correlated with increase in IL-6 (r = 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.56, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in Lp(a) levels during the acute phase of COVID-19 were strongly associated with VTE incidence. The acute increase in anti-fibrinolytic Lp(a) may tilt the balance to VTE in patients hospitalized for COVID-19."
4,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,"Confronted with an emerging infectious disease at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community faced concerns regarding the safety of autopsies on those who died of the disease. This attitude has changed, and autopsies are now recognized as indispensable tools for understanding COVID-19, but the true risk of infection to autopsy staff is nevertheless still debated. To clarify the rate of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs were taken at nine points in the PPE of one physician and one assistant after each of 11 full autopsies performed at four centers. Swabs were also obtained from three minimally invasive autopsies (MIAs) conducted at a fifth center. Lung/bronchus swabs of the deceased served as positive controls, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR. In 9 of 11 full autopsies, PPE samples tested RNA positive through PCR, accounting for 41 of the 198 PPE samples taken (21%). The main contaminated items of the PPE were gloves (64% positive), aprons (50% positive), and the tops of shoes (36% positive) while the fronts of safety goggles, for example, were positive in only 4.5% of the samples, and all the face masks were negative. In MIAs, viral RNA was observed in one sample from a glove but not in other swabs. Infectious virus isolation in cell culture was performed on RNA-positive swabs from the full autopsies. Of all the RNA-positive PPE samples, 21% of the glove samples, taken in 3 of 11 full autopsies, tested positive for infectious virus. In conclusion, PPE was contaminated with viral RNA in 82% of autopsies. In 27% of autopsies, PPE was found to be contaminated even with infectious virus, representing a potential risk of infection to autopsy staff. Adequate PPE and hygiene measures, including appropriate waste deposition, are therefore essential to ensure a safe work environment."
5,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of Covid-19 had negative impacts on the mental stress and induced psychological distress among university students worldwide. This study proposed a moderated mediation model, and hypothesized that the Covid-19 pandemic-related stress was positively related to depressive symptoms among international medical students. METHODS: An online survey on stress and depressive symptoms of international students was conducted in a medical university. Questions on Covid-19 pandemic-related stress, Patient Health Quesionnaire-9, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and the Perceived Social Support Scale were used as measurements, and model analyses were conducted using Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS. RESULTS: It was found that 9.83%, 3.08% and 2.12% students had mild, moderate and severe depressive symptoms, respectively, and the positive association between Covid-19 pandemic-related stress and depressive symptoms was significant (beta = 0.27, t = 6.87, P < 0.01). Negative coping was also significantly correlated to depressive symptoms (beta = 0.26, t = 6.60, P < 0.01), and partially mediated the association between Covid-19 pandemic-related stress and depressive symptoms. Perceived social support had a negative association with depressive symptoms (beta=-0.26, t=-6.25, P < 0.01), played a negative moderating role in the relationship between negative coping and depressive symptoms, and moderated the indirect effect of Covid-19 pandemic-related stress on depressive symptoms via negative coping. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study suggested that under the background of continuing pandemic, intervention or prevention of mental health problem is urgently needed for the international students, and depression may be alleviated through reducing negative coping and increasing perceived social support."
6,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases","SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, an ongoing pandemic, engages the ACE2 receptor to enter the host cell through S protein priming by a serine protease, TMPRSS2. Variation in the TMPRSS2 gene may account for the disparity in disease susceptibility between populations. Therefore, in the present study, we have used next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of world populations from 393 individuals and analyzed the TMPRSS2 gene using a haplotype-based approach with a major focus on South Asia to study its phylogenetic structure and their haplotype sharing among various populations worldwide. Our analysis of phylogenetic relatedness showed a closer affinity of South Asians with the West Eurasian populations therefore, host disease susceptibility and severity particularly in the context of TMPRSS2 will be more akin to West Eurasian instead of East Eurasian. This is in contrast to our prior study on the ACE2 gene which shows South Asian haplotypes have a strong affinity towards West Eurasians. Thus ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have an antagonistic genetic relatedness among South Asians. Considering the significance of the TMPRSS2 gene in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, COVID-19 infection and intensity trends could be directly associated with increased expression therefore, we have also tested the SNPs frequencies of this gene among various Indian state populations with respect to the case fatality rate (CFR). Interestingly, we found a significant positive association between the rs2070788 SNP (G Allele) and the CFR among Indian populations. Further our cis eQTL analysis of rs2070788 shows that the GG genotype of the rs2070788 tends to have a significantly higher expression of TMPRSS2 gene in the lung compared to the AG and AA genotypes thus validating the previous observation and therefore it might play a vital part in determining differential disease vulnerability. We trust that this information will be useful in understanding the role of the TMPRSS2 variant in COVID-19 susceptibility and using it as a biomarker may help to predict populations at risk."
7,Cureus,"COVID-19 Infection has wrecked havoc all over the world; the spectrum of this disease ranges from asymptomatic mild cases to severe cases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Not only the acute infection but post COVID sequelae are also a cause of concern. Post-COVID states or Long COVID are the sequences of complications following the active infection. As post COVID sequelae are unpredictable it is absolutely the need of the hour to educate physicians and make them aware of all possibilities. We report one such case of a post COVID recovered young lady, who presented with drug-refractory recurrent palpitations. She was initially suspected to have inappropriate sinus tachycardia. But electrophysiological study confirmed the diagnosis of atrial tachycardia which was successfully ablated. The patient now has completed six months of follow-up and is off any medication."
8,"Anatomia, histologia, embryologia","Teaching Veterinary Anatomy in a virtual world is an utmost requirement of the ongoing era of COVID-19 pandemic. Due to sudden lockdown, all the educational institutes, professional medical and veterinary colleges were closed (except emergency services) and academic activities were suspended altogether. This situation was challenging as well as thought-provoking for various academicians and professors to rethink about the means to keep the conduit of imparting education unceasing. This review focuses on the virtual reality aids that are being adopted worldwide and the initiatives taken by academicians during this era to impart best practical anatomy lessons yet being in a socially distant world. However, during the lockdown and social distancing, face-to face interactions were not feasible, and therefore, number of distant learning methods were created on virtual platforms for continuing the process of teaching veterinary anatomy closer to reality available at their doorsteps where academic staff was actively involved to reconstruct and renovate resources, upgraded their digital competencies to develop new ways to shift from one on one and merged to remote online teaching, and anatomy teaching was transformed to an abrupt 'virtual mode'. Adopting virtual reality (VR) aids such as 3D animations, software packages, virtual dissections and E-museum serves as a great saviour throughout this unprecedented pandemic in a socially distant world to continue the teaching connexion."
9,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant negative socio-political, economic, and psychological consequences. AIMS: To investigate the impact of individual-level (illness representations of COVID-19) and structurally derived (anticipated social-political development in the economy, security, and social harmony in the next year) factors, and their potential moderation effects on depressive symptoms. METHODS: An anonymous population-based telephone survey was conducted among the general public of Hong Kong, China during 3-10 April 2020 (n = 300, response rate 56%). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the validated Chinese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Of the participants, 8.7% showed probable moderate-to-severe depression. Hierarchical linear regression models showed that illness representations of personal/treatment control and emotional responses and anticipated deterioration in social harmony were independently and significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Anticipated deterioration in security significantly moderated the associations between perceived consequence/treatment control of COVID-19 and depressive symptoms, such that the associations were stronger among people who anticipated a strong deterioration in security. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that perceptions of COVID-19 and future social-political development jointly and interactively contributed to depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health professionals and promotions should take the multiple-level mental health determinants into account."
