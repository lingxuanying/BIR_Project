5,Neurological research,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) arising from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection has caused a worldwide pandemic, mainly owing to its highly virulent nature stemming from a very strong and highly efficacious binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. As the pandemic developed, increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations were reported, strongly suggesting a causal relationship. Indeed, direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles into the brain can occur through the cribriform plate via olfactory nerves, passage through a damaged blood-brain-barrier, or via haematogenic infiltration of infected leukocytes. Neurological complications range from potentially fatal encephalopathy and stroke, to the onset of headaches and dizziness, which despite their apparent innocuous presentation may still imply a more sinister pathology. Here, we summarize the most recent knowledge on the neurological presentations typically being associated with COVID-19, whilst providing potential pathophysiological mechanisms. The latter are centered upon hypoxic brain injury, generation of a cytokine storm with attendant immune-mediated damage, and a prothrombotic state. A better understanding of both the neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurological complications of COVID-19 will be important to improve patient outcomes."

7,Leukemia & lymphoma,Hematology patients are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 than patients with other cancers. We surveyed hematology patients to better understand their experiences of cancer care during the pandemic. A large reduction was observed in the number of healthcare services accessed by respondents. Telehealth assisted with access but requires improvement.
8,Cureus,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been a global concern since January 2020. Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh, is facing outbreaks of endemic diseases such as dengue. Here, we report the case of an eight-year-old female from Dhaka with high-grade, continued fever, shock, features of pneumonia, and plasma leakage with multiple organ dysfunction. Both nonstructural protein 1 antigen (NS1 Ag) for dengue and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 were positive in the patient. The echocardiographic evaluation showed coronary arterial dilatations. The patient was managed according to the WHO guidelines for dengue with immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and aspirin for the involvement of coronary arteries. The patient required a mechanical ventilator due to pulmonary hemorrhage and unstable vitals. She showed gradual improvement with timely managements. Although a single case report does not portray the full picture, through this case report, we aim to describe the severity of co-infection of the mentioned viruses in a child in Bangladesh during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. Without appropriate diagnosis and management, it can be fatal."
