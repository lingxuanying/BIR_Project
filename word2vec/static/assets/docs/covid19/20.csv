1,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,"We studied the immunogenicity of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in health-care workers of a major infectious diseases hospital in Vietnam. We measured neutralizing antibodies before and 14 days after each dose, and at day 28 and month 3 after dose 1. A total of 554 workers (136 men and 418 women; age range, 22-71 years; median age, 36 years) participated with the study. Of the 144 participants selected for follow-up after dose 1, 104 and 94 gave blood for antibody measurement at weeks 6 and 8, and at month 3 after dose 1, respectively. The window time between the two doses was 6 weeks. At baseline, none had detectable neutralizing antibodies. After dose 1, the proportion of participants with detectable neutralizing antibodies increased from 27.3% (151 of 554) at day 14 to 78.0% (432 of 554) at day 28. Age correlated negatively with the development and the levels of neutralizing antibodies. However, at day 28, these differences were less profound, and women had a greater seroconversion rate and greater levels of neutralizing antibodies than men. After dose 2, these age and gender associations were not observable. In addition, the proportion of study participants with detectable neutralizing antibodies increased from 70.2% (73 of 104) before dose 2 (week 6, after dose 1) to 98.1% (102 of 104) 14 days later. At month 3, neutralizing antibodies decreased and 94.7% (89 of 94) of the study participants remained seropositive. The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is immunogenic in Vietnamese health-care workers. These data are critical to informing the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, where vaccination coverage remains inadequate."
2,European heart journal. Case reports,"Background: Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is characterized by the presence of sterile vegetations on a cardiac valve. We present a case of multi-territory stroke caused by embolism of a non-bacterial thrombotic aortic valve endocarditis, leading to the diagnosis of a prostate adenocarcinoma with bone metastases. Case summary: A 66-year-old patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, first attributed to an asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Edoxaban was started, which was discontinued by the patient. Four weeks later, he presented with subacute vertigo and balance disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a multi-territory stroke. A transoesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a small vegetation on the aortic valve with moderate aortic insufficiency. Blood cultures remained negative. Malignancy screening showed a markedly elevated prostate-specific antigen. Prostate adenocarcinoma was confirmed on biopsy. A positron emission tomography revealed metastatic disease. A diagnosis of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and paraneoplastic pulmonary embolism secondary to prostate cancer was made. Edoxaban was restarted and the patient was referred for treatment of the prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up after 5 months showed no evidence of aortic valve vegetations. Discussion: Coronavirus disease 2019 in ambulatory patients may be insufficient as a predisposing factor for venous thrombo-embolism and these patients, especially the elderly, should undergo a screening for malignancy. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is a rare cause of multi-territory stroke. When related to cancer, the prostate can be the primary tumour."
3,BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government implemented a series of guidelines, rules, and restrictions to change citizens' behaviour to tackle the spread of the virus, such as the promotion of face masks and the imposition of lockdown stay-at-home orders. The success of such measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens, but compliance was not complete. Detailed research is required on the factors that aided or hindered compliance with these measures. METHODS: To understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 26,000 free-text survey responses from 17,500 UK adults, collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020. RESULTS: The main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to oneself and one's family and friends and to, a lesser extent, the general public. Also of importance were a desire to return to normality, the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends, and the ability to work from home. Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public (due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints), the need to provide or receive support from family and friends, social isolation, missing loved ones, and mental health impacts, perceiving the risks as low, social pressure to not comply, and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules. Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics. Notably, women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated an array of factors contributed to compliance with guidelines. Of particular policy importance, the results suggest that government communication that emphasizes the potential risks of the virus and provides simple, consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours as COVID-19 continues and for future pandemics."
4,Frontiers in psychology,"This study aims to investigate the intervention effect of group sandplay on the interpersonal sensitivity of college students and analyze the relationship between the theme and interactive behavior characteristics and the intervention effect of group sandplay especially during the period of COVID-19. Sixty college students were randomly assigned to the experimental group (group sandplay) or the control group (neutral task interventions). The results showed that the interpersonal sensitivity level of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. For the experimental group, the variation in the interpersonal sensitivity level was significantly negatively correlated with the change in warm, supportive behavior during group sandplay interaction. These findings suggest that group sandplay is effective in improving the interpersonal sensitivity level of college students, and this effect can be positively predicted by warm and supportive interaction behaviors in group sandplay."
5,Communications biology,"As the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic continues to spread, several variants of the virus, with mutations distributed all over the viral genome, are emerging. While most of the variants present mutations having little to no effects at the phenotypic level, some of these variants are spreading at a rate that suggests they may present a selective advantage. In particular, these rapidly spreading variants present specific mutations on the spike protein. These observations call for an urgent need to characterize the effects of these variants' mutations on phenotype features like contagiousness and antigenicity. With this aim, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on a selected set of possible spike variants in order to assess the stabilizing effect of particular amino acid substitutions on the molecular complex. We specifically focused on the mutations that are both characteristic of the top three most worrying variants at the moment, i.e the English, South African, and Amazonian ones, and that occur at the molecular interface between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its human ACE2 receptor. We characterize these variants' effect in terms of (i) residue mobility, (ii) compactness, studying the network of interactions at the interface, and (iii) variation of shape complementarity via expanding the molecular surfaces in the Zernike basis. Overall, our analyses highlighted greater stability of the three variant complexes with respect to both the wild type and two negative control systems, especially for the English and Amazonian variants. In addition, in the three variants, we investigate the effects a not-yet observed mutation in position 501 could provoke on complex stability. We found that a phenylalanine mutation behaves similarly to the English variant and may cooperate in further increasing the stability of the South African one, hinting at the need for careful surveillance for the emergence of these mutations in the population. Ultimately, we show that the proposed observables describe key features for the stability of the ACE2-spike complex and can help to monitor further possible spike variants."
6,Social science & medicine (1982),"BACKGROUND: Redlining was a racialized zoning practice in the U.S. that blocked fair access to home loans during the 1930s, and recent research is illuminating health problems in the current residents of these historically redlined areas. However, this work has not yet been holistically summarized. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis comparing health outcomes in redlined versus non-redlined neighborhoods in U.S. cities. METHODS: We extracted relevant articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Science Direct databases published from January 2010 to September 2021. RESULTS: The search revealed 12 studies on preterm births (n = 3), gunshot-related injuries (n = 2), cancer (n = 1), asthma (n = 1), self-rated health (n = 1), multiple health outcomes (n = 2), heat-related outcomes (n = 1) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality (n = 1). A meta-analysis of three studies found the odds of having preterm birth was significantly higher (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.88; p = 0.02) among women living in redlined areas compared to those in non-redlined areas. Review of other outcomes revealed that gunshot-related injuries, asthma, heat-related outcomes, and multiple chronic conditions were worse in redlined areas, while associations with cancer varied by cancer type. In terms of cause-specific mortality, one study revealed no link between residential redlining and infant mortality rate, while one study on COVID-19 outcomes was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review presents evidence that living in historically redlined areas is associated with increased risk of multiple serious adverse health outcomes. Further research on mechanisms, remediation, and neighborhood-level interventions is needed to strengthen the understanding of the impacts of redlining on health."

8,JAMA oncology,"Importance: Patients with solid cancer are more susceptible to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe complications; the immunogenicity in patients treated with anticancer agents remains unknown. Objective: To assess the immune humoral response to 2 or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 (BioNTech; Pfizer) vaccine in patients treated with anticancer agents. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted between February 1 and May 31, 2021. Adults treated with anticancer agents who received 2 or 3 doses of vaccine were included; of these, individuals with a weak humoral response 1 month after the second dose received a third injection. Interventions: Quantitative serologic testing of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted before vaccination and during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: Humoral response was evaluated with a threshold of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody levels at 1000 arbitrary units (AU)/mL to neutralize less-sensitive COVID-19 variants. Results: Among 163 patients (median [range] age, 66 [27-89] years, 86 men [53%]) with solid tumors who received 2 or 3 doses of vaccine, 122 individuals (75%) were treated with chemotherapy, 15 with immunotherapy (9%), and 26 with targeted therapies (16%). The proportions of patients with an anti-S immunoglobulin G titer greater than 1000 AU/mL were 15% (22 of 145) at the time of the second vaccination and 65% (92 of 142) 28 days after the second vaccination. Humoral response decreased 3 months after the second dose. Treatment type was associated with humoral response; in particular, time between vaccine and chemotherapy did not interfere with the humoral response. Among 36 patients receiving a third dose of vaccine, a serologic response greater than 1000 AU/mL occurred in 27 individuals (75%). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this cohort study appear to support the use of a third vaccine dose among patients with active cancer treatment for solid tumors."
9,Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,"A retrospective analysis of the admissions to the pediatric emergency department requiring emergency endoscopy was performed, to evaluate if changes in the lifestyle and hospital practices imposed by the pandemic had an impact on the frequency and profile of the emergency endoscopy. The first 6 months of the pandemic (Group A) were compared with the homologous period of the previous year (Group B). Eight-nine cases were analyzed. Most emergency endoscopies occurred in children under the age of two (28%) and most of these in Group A (p = 0.009). More foreign bodies were removed in Group A (p = 0.026). There were no statistically significant differences on the time to reach the emergency department (p = 0.934) or on the time delay since emergency room admission until the endoscopic procedure (p = 0.266). Overall, the pandemic did not seem to affect the quality of healthcare practice concerning emergency endoscopic procedures."
