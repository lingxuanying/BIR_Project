Results showed that, despite similar levels of social distancing, student distancing was predicted only by feelings of threat about COVID-19, whereas community distancing was predicted by both feeling informed and threatened. Examining longitudinal effects, which were limited to students only, students became more informed about COVID-19 over time, and increases in being informed (but not feeling threatened) predicted more distancing."

In a convenience sample of 957 HCWs who completed an anonymous online survey between April-May 2020, HCWs who provided direct care to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients reported increased depressive and posttraumatic symptoms compared to HCWs with no COVID-19 patient contact. Additionally, more frequent contact was associated with higher distress. More data drawn from diverse samples that better represent US HCWs are needed to fully assess the scope of this association."

It has resulted in a slew of social problems for the millions of people in society. Elder abuse is one of them. Elder abuse due to COVID-19 pandemic is a matter of grave concern in Indian society. Today, due to COVID-19 pandemic, older people are facing social rejection, mental torture and abusive behaviour by family members, relatives, neighbours and caregivers. The objectives of present study are to examine the nature of elder abuse due to COVID-19 pandemic under the theoretical framework of anomie theory and to explore its outcome on the well-being of older people. The study uses phenomenological content analysis method. The information has been gathered from many Indian newspapers, magazines and news portals. The researchers examined the content of news stories about elder abuse that were published between 1 April 2021 and 15 May, 2021 and analysed the results. The study finds that older people have been abused due to fear of COVID-19 infection, poor financial condition and irresponsibility of caregivers. Most often, elders suffer abuse at the hands of their loved ones, neighbours and caregivers."
4,Cureus,"Due to the microvascular effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), head and neck reconstructive surgeries utilizing free tissue transfers may be profoundly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the immediate postoperative period. Our objective is to describe two adult patients who developed SARS-CoV-2 after undergoing relatively uncomplicated segmental mandibulectomies. In both cases, the patients were initially negative for SARS-CoV-2, underwent relatively uncomplicated segmental mandibulectomies with fibula free flap reconstructions, and were later discharged in stable conditions. Both patients subsequently experienced significant infectious sequelae at the donor and recipient sites with near-total split-thickness skin graft loss in the donor sites in the setting of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first patient developed sepsis and gangrenous changes to his fibula donor site requiring four operative debridements and partial amputation with subsequent osteomyelitis of the remaining fibula. The second patient experienced dehiscence of the oral fibula free flap as well as a 22 cm phlegmon at the fibula donor site that required surgical debridement. In consideration of these cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection during the immediate postoperative period of head and neck reconstruction procedures may elevate the risk of major wound complications. Special consideration must be taken when performing free tissue transfers during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Surgical practice has been significantly impacted with all specialties writing guidelines for how to manage during this crisis. This study reported the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the neurosurgical practice, especially neurospine, in the outpatient visit, emergency department, and the surgical procedure. Methods: This study is the comparative retrospective about neurospine practice in the outpatient visit, emergency department, and the surgical procedure among before and during COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded data from January to December 2019 (before COVID-19 pandemic) and compared with the same period in the 2020 (during a COVID-19 pandemic). Results: A total of the outpatient visits, the average number per month was 28 +/- 10.5 visits per month before the pandemic. The average number outpatient visit per month during the pandemic was 19 +/- 11.1 visits per month, with the lowest in July 2020. The result of the average monthly neurospine surgical procedure before the pandemic was 5 +/- 1.9 operations per month. Compared during the pandemic, there was decreased in the neurospine surgical procedure with the average number was 2 +/- 2.7 operations per month. The decreased number significantly happens in the surgical procedure and emergency department patient (P < 0.05), while in the outpatient visit, the decreased statistically not significantly (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic changed all scopes of medical practice and training. Considering the limitation in the available resources, the number of educational cases may decrease in subspecialized disciplines such as neurospine neurosurgery. The COVID-19 pandemic affects in the neurospine and neurosurgery treatment policy in the referral tertiary hospital."

8,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,"The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century with more than 257 million cases and over 5.17 million deaths reported worldwide (as of November 23, 2021. Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved. Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID (PF-07321332). Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint). However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases. Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic. In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVID summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses. Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity. The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide."
