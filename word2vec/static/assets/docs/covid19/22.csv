Nafamostat has been shown to have other, immunomodulatory effects, which may be beneficial for treatment, however animal models of ssRNA virus infection are lacking. In this study, we examined the potential of the dual TLR7/8 agonist R848 to mimic the host response to an ssRNA virus infection and the associated behavioural response. In addition, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of nafamostat in this model. METHODS: CD-1 mice received an intraperitoneal injection of R848 (200 mug, prepared in DMSO, diluted 1:10 in saline) or diluted DMSO alone, and an intravenous injection of either nafamostat (100 muL, 3 mg/kg in 5% dextrose) or 5% dextrose alone. Sickness behaviour was determined by temperature, food intake, sucrose preference test, open field and forced swim test. Blood and fresh liver, lung and brain were collected 6 h post-challenge to measure markers of peripheral and central inflammation by blood analysis, immunohistochemistry and qPCR. RESULTS: R848 induced a robust inflammatory response, as evidenced by increased expression of TNF, IFN-gamma, CXCL1 and CXCL10 in the liver, lung and brain, as well as a sickness behaviour phenotype. Exogenous administration of nafamostat suppressed the hepatic inflammatory response, significantly reducing TNF and IFN-gamma expression, but had no effect on lung or brain cytokine production. R848 administration depleted circulating leukocytes, which was restored by nafamostat treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that R848 administration provides a useful model of ssRNA virus infection, which induces inflammation in the periphery and CNS, and virus infection-like illness. In turn, we show that nafamostat has a systemic anti-inflammatory effect in the presence of the TLR7/8 agonist. Therefore, the results indicate that nafamostat has anti-inflammatory actions, beyond its ability to inhibit TMPRSS2, that might potentiate its anti-viral actions in pathologies such as COVID-19."

[et al.],"Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) is a neuropeptide regulating the release of Growth Hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland, and acts as a growth factor in a diverse variety of tissues. GHRH antagonists (GHRHAnt) have been developed to counteract those events, and the beneficial effects of those peptides toward homeostasis have been associated with anti-inflammatory activities. Our lab is interested in delineating the mechanisms governing endothelial barrier function. Our goal is to establish new grounds on the development of efficient countermeasures against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which has been associated with thousands of deaths worldwide due to COVID-19. Herein we demonstrate in vivo that GHRHAnt suppresses LPS-induced increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein concentration, thus protecting the lungs against edema and inflammation."

4,Cureus,"Case reports have discussed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients presenting with hemolytic anemia, specifically with a positive direct antiglobulin test. However, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia in COVID-19 patients has been rarely reported. We present an unusual case of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which responded with evidence-based COVID-19 treatments. We demonstrate the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, and we illustrate how treatment of the underlying COVID-19 illness, even if it is just supportive care, will help resolve the associated hemolysis."

8,Journal of medical virology,"The recent emergence of a new variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) called Omicron (B.1.1.529) has raised paramount concerns in scientific and medical communities due to the presence of several mutations in the spike protein, many of which are located within the receptor binding domain (RBD).(1) Some of these mutations were found to have a substantial influence on host cells receptor and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies binding,(2) which may then impact infectivity and neutralizing antibodies escape, thus potentially magnifying the risk of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine breakthrough. We have hence carried out a scientific literature search, aimed at summarizing the currently published evidence on Omicron variant neutralizing properties of serum or plasma collected from recipients of COVID-19 vaccines."
9,The Journal of infectious diseases,"The purpose of this study was to assess if influenza vaccination has an impact on the risk of COVID-19. A cohort of 46,112 health care workers were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and filled in a survey on COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization, and influenza vaccination. The RR of hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 for influenza vaccinated compared with unvaccinated participants was 1.00 for the seasonal vaccination in 2019/2020 (CI 0.56-1.78, p=1.00). Likewise, no clinical effect of influenza vaccination on development of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was found. The present findings indicate that influenza vaccination does not affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19."
