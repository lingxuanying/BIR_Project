0,Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,"OBJECTIVES: The use of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis has been recommended by the National task force constituted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the prevention of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers (HCWs). However, this recommendation was based essentially on the preclinical data and limited clinical experience. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HCQ as a pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 infection among Indian HCWs. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs of a tertiary care hospital in north India. The HCQ prophylaxis was initiated among 996 HCWs and they were followed up to 8 weeks for conversion to COVID-19 positive status and any adverse drug reaction (ADR). RESULTS: About 10.3% of the study participants were tested positive for COVID-19 which was comparable to the positivity rate among HCWs not taking HCQ prophylaxis (9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: HCQ was well tolerated at a weekly dose of 400 mg for 8 weeks but provided no additional benefit in prevention of COVID-19 among HCWs."
1,Cureus,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome that is often fatal. In the adult population, it is believed to develop secondary to immune dysregulation due to rheumatologic, infectious, malignant, and recently, immunomodulatory drugs. It has been well documented that infectious etiologies can lead to HLH however to date there is a paucity of case reports of HLH stemming from the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, it is well established that overlap exists between the extensive hyper-inflammatory syndromes produced from both HLH and severe COVID-19 infection. Here, we present a case of COVID-19-associated HLH with recurrent neutropenic fever in a patient with controlled follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received treatment with etoposide after continued hospital admissions with refractory medical treatment."
2,PloS one,"In stressful situations such as the COVID-19-pandemic, unpleasant emotions are expected to increase while pleasant emotions will likely decrease. Little is known about the role cognitive appraisals, information management, and upregulating pleasant emotions can play to support emotion regulation in a pandemic. In an online survey (N = 1682), we investigated predictors of changes in pleasant and unpleasant emotions in a German sample (aged 18-88 years) shortly after the first restrictions were imposed. Crisis self-efficacy and felt restriction were predictors of changes in unpleasant emotions and joy alike. The application of emotion up-regulation strategies was weakly associated with changes in joy. Among the different upregulation strategies, only ""savouring the moment"" predicted changes in joy. Our study informs future research perspectives assessing the role of upregulating pleasant emotions under challenging circumstances."

Case reports,"Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare life-threatening clinical condition that can develop in patients younger than 21 years of age with a history of infection/exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The cardiovascular system is a main target of the inflammatory process that frequently causes myocardial dysfunction, myopericarditis, coronary artery dilation, hypotension, and shock. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children-associated myocarditis is usually characterized by fever, tachycardia, non-specific electrocardiogram abnormalities, and left ventricular dysfunction, but serious tachyarrhythmias may also occur. We report two cases of patients with MIS-C-associated myocarditis who developed severe bradycardia. Case summary: Two female adolescents with recent history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were initially hospitalized for long-lasting high-grade fever and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Both patients were diagnosed with MIS-C-associated myocarditis for elevation of markers of myocardial injury (mean highly-sensitive cardiac troponin 2663 pg/mL, mean N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide 5097 pg/mL) and left ventricular dysfunction, which was subsequently confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance. Both patients developed a severe sinus bradycardia (lowest heart rate 36 and 42, respectively), which appeared refractory to the treatment with intravenous Methylprednisolone and Immunoglobulins, despite a clinical and biochemical improvement. The use of Anakinra (a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist), was associated with a rapid improvement of cardiac rhythm and excellent clinical outcome at 6 months of follow-up. Discussion: In patients with MIS-C-associated myocarditis, a continuous cardiac monitoring is mandatory to promptly identify potential conduction abnormalities. Adolescents may present bradycardia as a rhythm complication. We experienced a rapid recovery after treatment with Anakinra, to be considered as add-on therapy in cases refractory to standard anti-inflammatory treatment."
4,European journal of psychotraumatology,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exposes individuals to multiple stressors, such as quarantine, physical distancing, job loss, risk of infection, and loss of loved ones. Such a complex array of stressors potentially lead to symptoms of adjustment disorder. Objective: This cross-sectional exploratory study examined relationships between risk and protective factors, stressors, and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data from the first wave of the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) longitudinal ADJUST Study were used. N = 15,563 participants aged 18 years and above were recruited in eleven countries (Austria, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden) from June to November 2020. Associations between risk and protective factors (e.g. gender, diagnosis of a mental health disorder), stressors (e.g. fear of infection, restricted face-to-face contact), and symptoms of adjustment disorder (ADNM-8) were examined using multivariate linear regression. Results: The prevalence of self-reported probable adjustment disorder was 18.2%. Risk factors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were female gender, older age, being at risk for severe COVID-19 illness, poorer general health status, current or previous trauma exposure, a current or previous mental health disorder, and longer exposure to COVID-19 news. Protective factors related to lower levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were higher income, being retired, and having more face-to-face contact with loved ones or friends. Pandemic-related stressors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder included fear of infection, governmental crisis management, restricted social contact, work-related problems, restricted activity, and difficult housing conditions. Conclusions: We identified stressors, risk, and protective factors that may help identify individuals at higher risk for adjustment disorder."

6,Biosensors & bioelectronics,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a global pandemic outbreak, opening the most severe socio-economic crisis since World War II. Different scientific activities have been emerged in this global scenario, including the development of innovative analytical tools to measure nucleic acid, antibodies, and antigens in the nasopharyngeal swab, serum, and saliva for prompt identification of COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the immune response to the vaccine. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva remains a challenge for the lack of sufficient sensitivity. To address this issue, we developed a novel paper-based immunoassay using magnetic beads to support the immunological chain and 96-well wax-printed paper plate as a platform for color visualization by using a smartphone combined with Spotxel free-charge app. To assess the reliability of the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, untreated saliva was used as a specimen and the calibration curve demonstrated a dynamic range up to 10 mug/mL, with a detection limit equal to 0.1 mug/mL. The effectiveness of this sustainable analytical tool in saliva was evaluated by comparing the data with the nasopharyngeal swab specimens sampled by the same patients and tested with Real-Time PCR reference method, founding 100% of agreement, even in the case of high Cycle Threshold (CT) numbers (low viral load). Furthermore, the positive saliva samples were characterized by the next-generation sequencing method, demonstrating the capability to detect the Delta variant, which is actually (July 2021) the most relevant variant of concern."
7,Journal of psychiatric research,"Perceiving that one has grown in positive ways following highly stressful experiences (perceived posttraumatic growth; PPTG) is common and sometimes--but not always--related to psychological wellbeing. However, PPTG is typically studied cross-sectionally and well after the stressful experience has passed; how PPTG might relate to wellbeing over time in an unprecedented, ongoing worldwide disaster such as the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. Thus, the current study sought to answer whether, in the midst of the pandemic, PPTG relates to subsequent wellbeing, broadly defined. Participants were N = 1544 MTurk workers who completed a five-wave (T1-T5) six-month longitudinal study. Current analyses focused on T2-T5 (ns = 860-712). At each time point, participants completed self-report measures of PPTG and wellbeing (depression, anxiety, stress, positive states of mind, alcohol use, posttraumatic stress). In cross-lagged panel models, PPTG was largely unrelated to subsequent wellbeing. Somewhat more evidence was found that increasing distress led to increases in PPTG, suggesting perceptions of growth may serve as a coping mechanism. PPTG does not appear to benefit adjustment to the COVID-19 pandemic and may simply reflect efforts to manage distress."

With nearly 20 million students enrolled in colleges across the U.S., the long-simmering mental health crisis in college students was likely further exacerbated by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study leveraged mobile health (mHealth) technology and sought to: i) characterize self-reported outcomes of physical, mental, and social health by COVID-19 status; ii) assess physical activity through consumer-grade wearable sensors (Fitbit(R)); and iii) identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity in a population of college students prior to release of the vaccine. METHODS: Detailed methods were previously published in JMIR Res Protocols (Cislo et al). After completing a baseline assessment (i.e., Time 0 [T0]) of demographics, mental, and social health constructs through the Roadmap 2.0 app, participants were instructed to use the app freely, to wear the Fitbit(R), and complete subsequent assessments at T1, T2 and T3, followed by a COVID-19 assessment of history and timing of COVID-19 testing and diagnosis (T4: ~14 days after T3). Continuous measures were described using means (M) and standard deviations (SD), while categorical measures were summarized using frequencies and proportions. Formal comparisons were made based on COVID-19 status. The multivariate model was determined by entering all statistically significant variables (P<.05) in univariable associations at once and then removing one variable at a time by backward selection until the optimal model was obtained. RESULTS: During the fall 2020 semester, 1,997 participants consented, enrolled, and met criteria for data analyses. There was a high prevalence of anxiety, as assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI), with moderate and severe levels in N=465 (24%) and N=970 (49%) students, respectively. Approximately, one-third of students reported having a mental health disorder (N=656, 33%). The average daily steps recorded in this student population was approximately 6500 (M=6474, SD=3371). Neither reported mental health nor step count were significant based on COVID-19 status (P=.52). Our analyses revealed significant associations of COVID-positivity with use of marijuana and alcohol (P =.020 and .046, respectively) and lower belief in public health measures (P=.003). In addition, graduate students were less likely and those with >/=20 roommates were more likely to report a COVID-19 diagnosis (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems were common in this student population. Several factors, including substance use, were associated with risk of COVID-19. These data highlight important areas for further attention, such as prioritizing innovative strategies that address health and well-being, considering the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on college students.
