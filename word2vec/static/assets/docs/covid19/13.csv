0,Irish journal of medical science,"BACKGROUND: Development of a prediction model using baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of diagnosis will aid us in early identification of the high-risk groups and devise pertinent strategies accordingly. Hence, we did this study to develop a prognostic-scoring system for predicting the COVID-19 severity in South India. METHODS: We undertook this retrospective cohort study among COVID-19 patients reporting to Hindu Mission Hospital, India. Multivariable logistic regression using the LASSO procedure was used to select variables for the model building, and the nomogram scoring system was developed with the final selected model. Model discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed. RESULTS: In total, 35.1% of the patients in the training set developed severe COVID-19 during their follow-up period. In the basic model, nine variables (age group, sex, education, chronic kidney disease, tobacco, cough, dyspnea, olfactory-gustatory dysfunction [OGD], and gastrointestinal symptoms) were selected and a nomogram was built using these variables. In the advanced model, in addition to these variables (except OGD), C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimer, and CT severity score were selected. The discriminatory power (c-index) for basic model was 0.78 (95%CI: 0.74-0.82) and advanced model was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.79-0.87). DCA showed that both the models are beneficial at a threshold probability around 10-95% than treat-none or treat-all strategies. CONCLUSION: The present study has developed two separate prognostic-scoring systems to predict the COVID-19 severity. This scoring system could help the clinicians and policymakers to devise targeted interventions and in turn reduce the COVID-19 mortality in India."
1,Nature metabolism,"Severe cases of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are associated with elevated blood glucose levels and metabolic complications. However, the molecular mechanisms for how SARS-CoV-2 infection alters glycometabolic control are incompletely understood. Here, we connect the circulating protein GP73 with enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We first demonstrate that GP73 secretion is induced in multiple tissues upon fasting and that GP73 stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. We further show that GP73 secretion is increased in cultured cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, after overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins and in lungs and livers of mice infected with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain. GP73 blockade with an antibody inhibits excessive glucogenesis stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and lowers elevated fasting blood glucose levels in infected mice. In patients with COVID-19, plasma GP73 levels are elevated and positively correlate with blood glucose levels. Our data suggest that GP73 is a glucogenic hormone that likely contributes to SARS-CoV-2-induced abnormalities in systemic glucose metabolism."
2,Journal of autoimmunity,"The emergence and rapid global spread of the new Delta and, more recently, Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose a daunting public health emergency. Being an RNA virus, the Covid-19 virus is continuing to mutate, resulting in the emergence of new variants with high transmissibility, such as the recently discovered Omicron variant. In this paper, we consider the conditions that may facilitate viral mutations and the emergence of variants with the ability to evade immunity. Here, we have discussed the importance of vaccination with the currently available vaccines. These vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious disease, hospitalization, and death from Covid-19. However, the antibody response induced by these vaccines is short-lasting and there are reports of breakthrough infections. A stable and persistent interaction between T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells is needed for robust B cell memory response. We discussed the potential reasons behind the breakthrough infections and underscored the importance of developing better second-generation vaccines that may not necessitate frequent booster immunizations and are preventive in nature. This may involve the development of multivalent vaccines and creating vaccines against other viral proteins including conserved proteins. Vaccine hesitancy remains a notable hurdle for implementing vaccination. Furthermore, we recommend different approaches to increase vaccine acceptance, which is a critical translational component of a successful vaccine strategy. These perspectives on overcoming the pandemic's current challenges provide strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2 globally."
3,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,"Background: Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are common comorbidities that portend worse outcomes due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Metabolic syndrome is the common denominator of these conditions. This study aims to characterize the association of metabolic syndrome and its surrogate biomarkers with severity of COVID-19 illness. Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who tested for COVID-19 at an academic tertiary care institution between March 8, 2020, and May 17, 2020. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the modified World Health Organization criteria. Outcomes of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death were analyzed. Results: There were 23,282 patients who tested for COVID-19 and 3679 (15.8%) had a positive result. Of these, metabolic syndrome was present in 834 (39%) of 2139 patients with available data. Patients with metabolic syndrome tended to be older, male, African American, heavier, and with more comorbidities. Metabolic syndrome was associated with higher rates of hospital admission and death (P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, patients with metabolic syndrome had an increased risk of 77% for hospitalization, 56% for ICU admission, and 81% for death (P < 0.001). High AST:ALT and TG:HDL-C ratios were associated with hospitalization and ICU admission, but not mortality. Conclusions: Patients with metabolic syndrome had significantly worse hospitalization and mortality rates due to COVID-19, even after adjusting for covariates. Targeting obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension could address modifiable risk factors to reduce mortality due to COVID-19."
4,Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,"Affordable housing is necessary for the health and well-being of children and families. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the ability of low-income families to pay for housing. The aim of this study is to evaluate associations between household characteristics of participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and housing-cost burden during the pandemic. WIC is a federally-funded nutrition assistance program for low-income mothers, infants, and children up to the age of 5. Data were from a 2020 survey of a random sample of WIC households (n = 5815) in Los Angeles County. Ordinal logistic regression determined the odds of being housing-cost burdened by parent respondent's race/ethnicity, household composition, employment, residence, and housing cost. Logistic regression determined if the pandemic contributed to the housing-cost burden. A total of 61% of households reported housing-cost burden, with two-thirds attributing the burden to the pandemic. Spanish-speaking Hispanic parents and white parents reported a higher prevalence of pandemic-related burden, while Asian, Black, and English-speaking Hispanic parents reported a higher prevalence of burden unrelated to the pandemic. Single-parent households, those experiencing residential instability, and those with high housing costs had higher odds of burden. Spanish-speaking Hispanic parents, white parents, homeowners, and those with high housing costs were more likely to attribute the burden to the pandemic. To ensure that existing inequities are not exacerbated, it is vital that housing assistance be available to low-income households that were disproportionately affected by the pandemic."
5,Pathogens and disease,"Given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus as a life-threatening pandemic, identification of immunodominant epitopes of the viral structural proteins, particularly the nucleocapsid (NP) protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, is important to determine targets for immunotherapy and diagnosis. In this study, epitope screening was performed using a panel of overlapping peptides spanning the entire sequences of the RBD and NP proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from 66 COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that while reactivity of patients' sera with reduced recombinant RBD protein was significantly lower than the native form of RBD (p<0.001), no significant differences were observed for reactivity of patients' sera with reduced and non-reduced NP protein. Pepscan analysis revealed weak to moderate reactivity towards different RBD peptide pools, which was more focused on peptides encompassing aa 181-223 of RBD. NP peptides, however, displayed strong reactivity with a single peptide covering aa 151-170. These findings were confirmed by peptide depletion experiments using both ELISA and Western blotting. Altogether, our data suggest involvement of mostly conformational disulfide bond-dependent immunodominant epitopes in RBD-specific antibody response, while the IgG response to NP is dominated by linear epitopes. Identification of dominant immunogenic epitopes in NP and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 could provide important information for the development of passive and active immunotherapy as well as diagnostic tools for the control of COVID-19 infection."
6,BioPsychoSocial medicine,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown had a considerable impact on eating disorders (EDs). We evaluated the clinical features of Japanese ED patients before and after the first COVID-19 outbreak-related state of emergency (April 7, 2020). METHODS: We studied 148 patients who were divided into two groups based on when they arrived at our clinic: before (Before group: n = 86) or after (After group: n = 62) the start of the first state of emergency. All patients completed the Japanese versions of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). RESULTS: The After group was substantially younger than the Before group (p = .0187). Regardless of the ED type, patients who developed an ED during the first state of emergency tended to be significantly younger than those who developed one before. Differences in EDI characteristics were observed between the two groups. The PBI care subscale was notably higher (p = .0177) in the After group. The PBI maternal care subscale was the only statistically significant factor associated with age (beta = -0.35, p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Home confinement associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing increase in parent-child closeness may have influenced the decreased age of ED patients at their initial consultation. Treatment interventions should consider the differences in the clinical features of EDs."
7,PloS one,"INTRODUCTION: Delay between symptom onset and access to care is essential to prevent clinical worsening for different infectious diseases. For COVID-19, this delay might be associated with the clinical prognosis, but also with the different characteristics of patients. The objective was to describe characteristics and symptoms of community-acquired (CA) COVID-19 patients at hospital admission according to the delay between symptom onset and hospital admission, and to identify determinants associated with delay of admission. METHODS: The present work was based on prospective NOSO-COR cohort data, and restricted to patients with laboratory confirmed CA SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Lyon hospitals between February 8 and June 30, 2020. Long delay of hospital admission was defined as >/=6 days between symptom onset and hospital admission. Determinants of the delay between symptom onset and hospital admission were identified by univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Data from 827 patients were analysed. Patients with a long delay between symptom onset and hospital admission were younger (p<0.01), had higher body mass index (p<0.01), and were more frequently admitted to intensive care unit (p<0.01). Their plasma levels of C-reactive protein were also significantly higher (p<0.01). The crude in-hospital fatality rate was lower in this group (13.3% versus 27.6%), p<0.01. Multiple analysis with correction for multiple testing showed that age >/=75 years was associated with a short delay between symptom onset and hospital admission (</=5 days) (aOR: 0.47 95% CI (0.34-0.66)) and CRP>100 mg/L at admission was associated with a long delay (aOR: 1.84 95% CI (1.32-2.55)). DISCUSSION: Delay between symptom onset and hospital admission is a major issue regarding prognosis of COVID-19 but can be related to multiple factors such as individual characteristics, organization of care and severe pathogenic processes. Age seems to play a key role in the delay of access to care and the disease prognosis."
8,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic precipitated lifestyle changes. We aimed to clarify whether COVID-19-induced lifestyle changes affected the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal study included 973 participants who underwent health checkups between 2018 and 2020. We used data from the MedCity21 health examination registry. Participants' clinical characteristics and lifestyle habits were investigated. Independent lifestyle predictors of MAFLD development before the pandemic (2018-2019) and during the pandemic (2019-2020) were identified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In 2018, 261 (27%) patients were diagnosed with MAFLD. Before the pandemic, 22 patients developed new MAFLD. During this time, routine late-night meals were identified as an independent lifestyle predictor of MAFLD development (hazard ratio [HR] 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-6.36, P=0.046). In contrast, 44 patients developed new MAFLD during the pandemic. During this time, higher daily alcohol intake was identified as an independent lifestyle predictor of MAFLD development (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, P=0.008). In participants aged <60 years, daily alcohol intake and the proportion of participants who ate 2 times/day were significantly higher in patients who developed MAFLD during the pandemic than in those who did not. In participants aged >/=60 years, no lifestyle habits were associated with MAFLD development before or during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: New MAFLD diagnoses increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in lifestyle factors, particularly in those aged <60 years, must be monitored and addressed as the pandemic continues."
9,European journal of psychotraumatology,"Background: Recent evidence showed adverse mental health outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including trauma-related symptoms. The Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) is a brief instrument designed to assess a broad range of trauma-related symptoms with no available validation in the Italian population. Aims: This study aimed to examine the factor structure of the Italian version of the GPS in a general population sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate trauma-related symptoms in the context of COVID-19 related risk factors associated with lockdown measures. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based observational study as part of a long-term monitoring programme of mental health outcomes in the general population. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven participants completed a self-report online questionnaire to collect key demographic data and evaluate trauma-related symptoms using the GPS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and PSS. Validation analyses included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and correlation analyses. The relation with putative COVID-19 related risk factors was explored by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported a two-factor model. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the best fitting model was a three-factor solution, with core Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal), Negative Affect (symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, irritability), and Dissociative symptoms. GPS Risk factors and specific COVID-19 related stressful events were associated with GPS total and the three factor scores. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a wide range of trauma-spectrum symptoms were reported by a large Italian sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GPS symptoms clustered best in three factors: Negative Affect symptoms, Core PTSS, and Dissociative symptoms. In particular, high rates of core PTSS and negative affect symptoms were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and should be routinely assessed in clinical practice."
