0,Neurology. Clinical practice,"Objective: To assess patient experiences with rapid implementation of ambulatory telehealth during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A mixed-methods study was performed to characterize the patients' experience with neurology telehealth visits during the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 response. Consecutive patients who completed a telehealth visit were contacted by telephone. Assenting patients completed a survey quantifying satisfaction with the visit followed by a semistructured telephone interview. Qualitative data were analyzed using the principles of thematic analysis. Results: A total of 2,280 telehealth visits were performed, and 753 patients (33%) were reached for postvisit feedback. Of these, 47% of visits were by video and 53% by telephone. Satisfaction was high, with 77% of patients reporting that all needs were met, although only 51% would consider telehealth in the future. Qualitative themes were constructed, suggesting that positive patient experiences were associated not only with the elimination of commute time and associated costs but also with a positive physician interaction. Negative patient experiences were associated with the inability to complete the neurologic examination. Overall, patients tended to view telehealth as a tool that should augment, and not replace, in-person visits. Conclusion: In ambulatory telehealth, patients valued convenience, safety, and physician relationship. Barriers were observed but can be addressed."
1,Respirology case reports,"Inflammatory processes, such as an infection or drug reaction, can cause antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Although quite rare, AAV may occur with SARS-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antigenic exposure, either from infection or immunization. We present two cases of AAV: one that developed after COVID-19 infection presenting as diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and another that developed shortly after vaccination, presenting as granulomatous pulmonary nodules. Both patients improved with supportive care and immunosuppressive therapies. This adverse event appears to be a very rare complication of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Early diagnosis of AAV is important because immunosuppressive therapy may improve patient outcomes."
2,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Salivary gland ducts are one of the primary targets of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Moreover, saliva contains minor and major salivary gland secretions and a combination of nasopharyngeal and lung secretions. The acrylic resin bases of complete or partial removable dentures have pores and provide a favorable environment for the growth of microorganisms. PURPOSE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the presence of viral contamination of acrylic resin removable denture bases in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The acrylic resin denture bases (partial and complete) of 29 patients with COVID-19 who underwent treatment in the Infectious Diseases Department of Razi Hospital in Ghaemshahr, Mazandaran, Iran, were evaluated. Samples were collected from the intaglio surface of the prostheses by direct swabbing and coding and were evaluated in a laboratory for the presence or absence of coronavirus. The relationship between hospital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denture PCR and the relationship between denture type and denture PCR were evaluated with the Fisher exact test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients, age range 55 to 85 years, 18 women, 3 with partial dentures and 26 with complete dentures, were evaluated. The hospital PCR test was positive in 28 patients, while the denture PCR test was positive in 4 patients. No significant relationship was observed between the results of hospital PCR and denture PCR in patients with COVID-19 (P=.138). All 4 patients who tested positive for denture PCR had complete dentures. No significant relationship was found between denture type and denture PCR test results in patients with COVID-19 (P=1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the microporous structure of the acrylic resin base, no statistically significant viral contamination was observed."

4,International medical case reports journal,"A South Asian male patient in his mid-forties presented with symptoms of severe 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) and recent brain infarction. Subsequently, he was found to have evidence of sepsis, underlying undetected diabetes mellitus (DM) and oral candida mucositis, possibly leading to the rare occurrence of direct spread to the lung, manifesting as a necrotizing candida lung abscess. We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the unique complication in this case that occurred during his admission, hospitalization, and eventual successful discharge from the hospital. This case highlights the importance of early identification and treatment of suspected COVID-19 infection based on clinical and radiological assessments before the confirmation of COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) test result, especially in patients with hyperglycemia. It also indicates the complications that can occur due to COVID-19 such as arteriovenous manifestations and the rare occurrence of pulmonary candida lung abscess. Early detection and prompt management by interdisciplinary teams in the emergency room, followed by close monitoring of complications in the intensive care unit (ICU), can lead to successful outcomes in severe/critical COVID-19 infection."
5,Gerontology & geriatric medicine,"One in five individuals in the United States provides care and support to ill, disabled, and aging family members in the home, leading to feelings of burden, stress, and poor health and well-being. Social support represents an important buffer for family caregivers that allows them to feel less isolated and more positive about their caregiving role. This sequential mixed-methods study aimed to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on family caregivers' social connections. Eighty-two caregivers completed a web-based survey which comprised of fixed-choice and open-ended questions. Survey data showed that the majority of caregivers (83%) reported an increase in stress and feeling lonely (77%) during the pandemic. Qualitative interviews with a subsample of caregivers (n=27) further explored social connections during the pandemic. Three themes echoed the quantitative findings and centered around defining boundaries, intentionality in social interactions, and loss of social resources. Although caregivers were often strained by new or increased caregiving demands, many experienced positive changes such as feeling a deeper connection with the care-recipient. Findings from this study highlight the need for further consideration of the impact of social isolation on the well-being of caregivers."
6,Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,"Acute chest pain is a common presentation in patients with COVID-19. Although noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities continue to be important cornerstones of management, the pandemic has brought forth difficult and unprecedented challenges in the provision of timely care while ensuring the safety of patients and providers. Clinical practice has adapted to these challenges, with several recommendations and societal guidelines emerging on the appropriate use of imaging modalities. In this review, we summarize the current evidence base on the use of noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities in COVID-19 patients with acute chest pain, with a focus on acute coronary syndromes."
7,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Background: General health includes physical and mental health and their interactions, and physical activity can improve people's mental and social health. The present study has compared general-social health and COVID-19-induced anxiety between active and inactive students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A causal-comparative research design was used in this study. The statistical population consisted of all students of the Farhangian University of Mashhad (2,500 students) in 2020, out of whom 752 students were randomly selected (323 men and 429 women). Subjects were assessed for general health, social health, and COVID-19-induced anxiety. Data normality was investigated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and data were analyzed statistically using independent t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient test. Results: The results of the present study showed that there was a significant difference between general health and COVID-19-induced anxiety of active and inactive students (p = 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between these two groups in social health (p >/= 0.05). Results obtained regarding the correlation indicated that there was a significant correlation between general and social health in both active and inactive students (p = 0.001). However, there was no significant correlation between COVID-19-induced anxiety and general-social health (p >/= 0.05). Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, it can be said that an active lifestyle and physical activity are important factors to improve general health and reduce anxiety, especially in specific conditions of the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, it is recommended that students have a regular exercise program to reduce their anxiety and increase the level of their physical health."
8,BMJ open,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt among healthcare workers and the role of vaccine confidence in decisions to vaccinate, and to better understand concerns related to COVID-19 vaccination. DESIGN: Cross-sectional anonymous survey among front-line, support service and administrative healthcare workers. SETTING: Two large integrated healthcare systems (one private and one public) in New York City during the initial roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine. PARTICIPANTS: 1933 healthcare workers, including nurses, physicians, allied health professionals, environmental services staff, researchers and administrative staff. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine receipt during the initial roll-out of the vaccine among healthcare workers. RESULTS: Among 1933 healthcare workers who had been offered the vaccine, 81% had received the vaccine at the time of the survey. Receipt was lower among black (58%; OR: 0.14, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2) compared with white (91%) healthcare workers, and higher among non-Hispanic (84%) compared with Hispanic (69%; OR: 2.37, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.1) healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, 65% received the vaccine. Among healthcare workers who agreed with the statement that the vaccine is important to protect family members, 86% were vaccinated. Of those who disagreed, 25% received the vaccine (p<0.001). In a multivariable analysis, concern about being experimented on (OR: 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.6), concern about COVID-19 vaccine safety (OR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.55), lack of influenza vaccine receipt (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44), disagreeing that COVID-19 vaccination is important to protect others (OR: 0.37, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.52) and black race (OR: 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59) were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine non-receipt. Over 70% of all healthcare workers responded that they had been approached for vaccine advice multiple times by family, community members and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated high overall receipt among healthcare workers. Even among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, side effects or being experimented on, over 50% received the vaccine. Attitudes around the importance of COVID-19 vaccination to protect others played a large role in healthcare workers' decisions to vaccinate. We observed striking inequities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt, particularly affecting black and Hispanic workers. Further research is urgently needed to address issues related to vaccine equity and uptake in the context of systemic racism and barriers to care. This is particularly important given the influence healthcare workers have in vaccine decision-making conversations in their communities."
9,International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,"In one experiment, we tested the influence of bringing to mind the memory of a special moment versus an ordinary moment from high school on gratitude and the relationship between gratitude and optimism. Participants were first asked to report how the current pandemic has affected their lives. After, participants were randomly assigned to either recalling a special moment from their high school years or recalling an ordinary event from the same life period. Participants then completed a battery of questionnaires assessing gratitude, optimism and some demographics. Results showed a positive influence of bringing to mind the memory of a special moment on gratitude. Gratitude was then positively related to optimism. Hence, the positive relationship between recalling a special event and optimism was mediated by gratitude. Our results showed that brief interventions might help individuals see a brighter future under the current difficult conditions of prolonged lockdowns."
