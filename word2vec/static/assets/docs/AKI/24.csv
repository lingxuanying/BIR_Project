2,[Acute renal insufficiency].,"The incidence of acute renal failure in children is higher due to the prevalence of diarrheal dehydration, use of nephrotoxic substances and sepsis. The occurrence in the newborn has increased, probably due to the large number of seriously sick infants maintained in neonatal intensive care units. Various laboratory examinations have been proposed as diagnostic indices of acute renal failure in children. Among these are the urine-to-plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine and the urine-to-plasma osmolality ratio. The fractional excretion of sodium and the so-called renal failure index are the most reliable of the diagnostic tests. The functional abnormalities and complications of acute renal failure include reduced glomerular filtration rate, retention of nitrogenous wastes, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia. The principles of management and treatment of complications are discussed."

9,Epidemiology of AKI in the ICU.,"Up to a little while ago there was no uniform definition for acute kidney injury (AKI). Recently, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative proposed the RIFLE consensus classification for AKI. This classification was adapted and modified by the Acute Kidney Injury Network into the AKI staging system. This classification defines 3 stages of severity of AKI, including less severe AKI. The incidence of AKI in ICU patients is increasing; severe AKI, treated by renal replacement therapy (RRT), has now an incidence comparable to that of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), and less severe AKI has an incidence comparable to that of sepsis. The prognosis of patients with AKI treated with RRT is still dim, with mortality rates between 50% and 60%. It is important to know that AKI is not only a consequence of severe disease, but also contributes to its worse outcome. Severe AKI, and less severe AKI, as defined by the AKI classification, have an independent association with mortality."
