1,[Intravenous fluid therapy and acute kidney injury - What's new?].,"Optimization of intravascular volume is crucial for patients who are at risk or undergo Acute Kidney Injury. In sepsis or after acute fluid loss extensive fluid expansion is mostly needed. However, in cardiorenal syndroms fluid overload can even lead to AKI itself and reduction of intravascular volume is needed. Thus, an individualized fluid guidance in terms of a ""fluid management stewartship"" for the right patient, the right drug, the right route and the right dose 1 has to be applied."

3,A review on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and kidney injury.,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is inevitable external life support in case of cardiac and respiratory failure since the 1970s. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and the requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a potential risk among these patients. This review aims to give an overview of the risk of AKI, RRT, and associated mortality among the patients who received ECMO for any of its indications. PubMed database was searched to find the relevant literature and the reference list of included studies was also searched for additional studies. The incidence of AKI ranged from 30% to 78% and RRT from 47% to 60% in ECMO patients. The pathophysiology of AKI in ECMO is multifactorial, and includes ischaemia, RBCs breakdown, comorbidity, conversion of zymogen form of pro-inflammatory mediators, structural alteration of the kidney, coadministration of nephrotoxic drugs, coagulation abnormality, and oxidative stress. ECMO was associated with the higher incidence of renal abnormalities, AKI, requirement of RRT, and associated mortality. Patients who underwent RRT had improved renal function and reduced overall mortality compared to the non-RRT group among the ECMO patients. Currently, there is no consensus evidence to support the superior use of the inline hemofilter system over continuous renal replacement therapy among patients who had AKI during ECMO."

6,"Acute kidney injury in children: prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.","Pediatric acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology has shifted from primary kidney disease to secondary to another organ system illness or its treatment with nephrotoxic medications. Similar to adult patients, critically ill children with AKI with multiorgan failure exhibit high mortality rates, yet conducting interventional trials to prevent, treat or mitigate the effects of AKI in children have been hampered by relatively low event rates and the reliance on serum creatinine as the biomarker of AKI. However, recent advancements in standardizing the AKI definition via the pediatric modified RIFLE criteria, multicenter collaboration via the Prospective Pediatric CRRT Registry Group and multiple validation studies of novel AKI biomarkers in children have provided the essential components to evaluate preventive and therapeutic strategies to attack pediatric AKI as a disease state. The scope of this article is to review the advancements in the study of pediatric AKI over the past decade and offer a compelling and bright view of what is on the horizon for the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of AKI in kids."

8,A comparison of the RIFLE and Acute Kidney Injury Network classifications for cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury: a prospective cohort study.,"Objectives: There is an intense debate on whether the RIFLE (R-renal risk, I-injury, F-failure, L-loss of kidney function, E-end-stage renal disease) classification or its recent modification, the Acute Kidney Injury Network definition and classification system should be used to standardize research on acute kidney injury. In this study we compared these classifications with regard to (1) the detection of acute kidney injury, (2) their agreement according to the grading of acute kidney injury across classes, and (3) their prognostic value. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 282 cardiac surgery patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and assigned a RIFLE and Acute Kidney Injury Network class to each patient. The incidence of acute kidney injury and in-hospital mortality across classes was compared by using the chi(2) test, and their prognostic value was compared by using the area under the curve receiver-operating characteristic for in-hospital mortality. Results: According to the RIFLE (45.8%) or Acute Kidney Injury Network (44.7%) classification, a similar proportion of patients had acute kidney injury. There was large agreement between classifications according to patients graded as having nonacute kidney injury; however, there was some disagreement across classes for staging the severity of acute kidney injury. The area under the curve for in-hospital mortality was similar for all classifications: 0.91 for the RIFLE classification (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.99) and 0.94 for the Acute Kidney Injury Network classification (95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.97; P = .6 for area under the curve comparison). Conclusions: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, modifications of the RIFLE classification for acute kidney injury do not materially improve the clinical usefulness of the definition. Other factors, such as the applicability of the acute kidney injury definition and classification system to be applied, need to be considered."
