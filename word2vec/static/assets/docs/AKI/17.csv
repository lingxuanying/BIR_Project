0,"Acute Kidney Injury in Low-Resource Settings: Barriers to Diagnosis, Awareness, and Treatment and Strategies to Overcome These Barriers.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly recognized as a major health problem worldwide, responsible for an estimated 1.4 million deaths per year. The occurrence of and approach to AKI in low-resource settings (LRS) present special challenges due to often limited health care resources, including insufficient numbers of trained personnel, diagnostic tools, and treatment options. Although the International Society of Nephrology set a goal of eliminating preventable deaths from AKI by 2025, implementation of this program in LRS presents major challenges not only because of the lack of resources, but also because of the lack of awareness of the impact of AKI on patient outcomes, factors that are complicated by the challenge of cognitively dissociating the care of patients with AKI from the care of patients with chronic kidney failure. To better understand how to increase the awareness of AKI and develop strategies to improve the identification and treatment of patients with AKI in LRS, we administered an 18-item web-based questionnaire to physicians actively engaged in providing nephrology care in LRS. A checklist was then developed of meaningful and targeted approaches for implementation, with focus on engaging local and regional stakeholders, developing education programs and appropriate guidelines, enhancing training of health care workers, expanding health care resources, linking with other regional health care projects, and broadening research opportunities."

2,A current view on the early diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney failure.,"Acute kidney injury is a syndrome characterized by a sudden, sustained, and potentially reversible decrease in glomerular filtration rate and tubular function, which globally impacts renal function. It comprises of a series of events starting with the presence of risk factors, then evolving towards acute kidney injury progression, characterized by stress, injury, and renal failure, culminating with either the use of renal replacement therapy or death. Currently, the use of biomarkers that differentiate between the initial functional deterioration and late-onset structural damage of the kidney enables the clinician to perform an early diagnosis and indicate treatment before the stages of acute kidney injury progression are established, thus increasing survival rates."
3,Evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit.,"Acute disorders of the kidney occur in up to two-thirds of patients in the intensive care unit. The diagnosis is associated with increased mortality and increased hospital stay. Often recognized but less frequently defined, it is commonly encountered by physicians caring for critically-ill patients. A standardized definition regarding acute kidney injury was published in 2004. This has led to improvements in measuring mortality and treatment outcomes with a more targeted approach to caring for these difficult to treat patients."

5,Fractional excretion of potassium in the course of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: potential monitoring tool?,"Objective: To evaluate the behavior of fractional excretion of potassium in the course of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. Methods: As part of a larger study in which we have evaluated blood and urinary parameters in the course of acute kidney injury, 168 patients were included. Blood and urine samples were collected daily until the removal of the urinary catheter or the initiation of renal replacement therapy. We describe the evolution of fractional excretion of potassium based on whether acute kidney injury was diagnosed, its duration (transient or persistent) and its severity (creatinine-based Acute Kidney Injury Network - AKIN stage). The diagnostic performance of fractional excretion of potassium in predicting the duration of acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement therapy on the day of acute kidney injury diagnosis was also evaluated. Results: Fractional excretion of potassium was significantly higher in persistent acute kidney injury compared to transient acute kidney injury on the day of acute kidney injury diagnosis (24.8 vs. 13.8%, p<0.001). Both groups had the median fractional excretion of potassium increasing in the two days preceding the acute kidney injury diagnosis. Patients without acute kidney injury had stable low fractional excretion of potassium values. The fractional excretion of potassium was fairly accurate in predicting persistent acute kidney injury (area under the curve: 0.712; 95% confidence interval: 0.614-0.811; p<0.001) on the day of acute kidney injury diagnosis. The area under the curve was 0.663 (95% confidence interval: 0.523-0.803; p=0.03) for renal replacement therapy. The fractional excretion of potassium increased with maximum AKIN stage reached, in both transient and persistent acute kidney injury. Conclusion: Sequential fractional excretion of potassium assessment appears to be useful in critically ill patients at risk for acute kidney injury."
