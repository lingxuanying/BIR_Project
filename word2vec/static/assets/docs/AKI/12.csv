0,Acute kidney injury in China.,"China has a large population and bears a heavy burden of kidney diseases. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in China and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The inadequacies of early diagnosis and management remain the major challenges to Chinese nephrologists. There is an urgent need for a nationwide, or even a global effort to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI, to develop professional preventive strategies, as well as to achieve early diagnosis and early intervention. In this article, we review the increasing incidence of AKI and complexity behind prevention and management, focusing on differences in various clinical settings in China."
1,Outcome of acute kidney injury in severe burns: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Purpose: The main objective of this review was to analyse the prevalence and outcome of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with severe burn injury. AKI is a common complication in patients with severe burn injury and one of the major causes of death (often combined with other organ dysfunctions). Several definitions of AKI have been used, but the RIFLE 'consensus' classification is nowadays considered the gold standard, enabling a more objective comparison of populations. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search (1960-2009), involving PubMed, the Web of Science, the search engine Google and textbooks. Reference lists and the Science Citation Index search were also consulted. Attributable mortality was assessed by performing a meta-analysis. Results: This search yielded 57 articles and abstracts with relevant epidemiologic data of AKI in the burn population. Of these, 30 contained complete mortality data of the burn and control population, which revealed a 3- to 6-fold higher mortality for AKI patients in univariate analysis, depending on the applied definition. When defined by the RIFLE consensus classification, AKI occurred in one quarter of patients with severe burn injury (median mortality of 34.9%), and when defined by the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), AKI occurred in 3% (median mortality of 80%). The prevalence of AKI slightly increased, but AKI-RRT decreased. However, the outcome in both groups improved. Conclusion: Despite the wide variation of the analysed burn populations and definitions of AKI, this review clearly showed that AKI remains prevalent and is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe burn injury."
2,[Acute kidney injury: update 2016].,Acute kidney injury is still defined by the functional parameters diuresis and serum creatinine. New biomarkers can be sensible additions for the detection of pathogenesis and prognosis. Risk stratification is also very useful for identification of patients at risk for the development of acute kidney injury. This is of increased importance as usual therapeutic treatments are rare and long-term effects are devastating.

4,[Ultrasound and color Doppler in nephrology. Acute kidney injury].,"At present, ultrasonography (US) is not able to define the type of renal damage and therefore cannot replace percutaneous renal biopsy in the diagnosis of acute kidney disease. It is, however, the most immediate and safest imaging technique for the evaluation of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in order to exclude urinary tract obstruction or chronic kidney disease and guide clinical decision-making. In prerenal AKI caused by cardiorenal syndrome type 1, US does not show specific signs. However, in these patients, pleuropulmonary US is the first-choice imaging technique to evaluate the congestion of subpleural interlobular septa and to identify and count lung comet tails. In cardiorenal syndrome type 2, US visualizes signs of systemic overload (right pleural effusion, liver stasis, overdistention and rigidity of the inferior vena cava and suprahepatic veins). In acute tubular necrosis (ATN), the most common type of AKI, gray-scale US is nonspecific and shows enlarged kidneys with hypoechoic pyramids due to medullary edema. The resistance index (RI) is a very useful marker to establish the severity of ATN and the required follow-up, and to evaluate functional recovery, since its reduction precedes the normalization of serum creatinine. US is the technique of choice in the diagnosis of obstructive nephropathy, where it is highly sensitive (>95%) but less specific (<70%). The primary objective of this review is to analyze the applications of US in the diagnosis of prerenal, renal and postrenal AKI."

6,Cardiac surgery and acute kidney injury: emerging concepts.,"Purpose of review: To review recent advances in understanding of the occurrence, pathophysiology, prophylaxis and treatment of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). Recent findings: New definitions and prompt diagnostic tools, enhanced risk stratification strategies, avoidance of nephrotoxins and procedure selection are all areas in which recent contributions to the literature have improved perioperative care for cardiac surgery patients. Although evidence continues to confirm the adverse effects of extreme hemodilution and transfusion as part of cardiac surgery, the previously believed advantages of tight perioperative glucose control for the kidney are being questioned in recent studies. Although very little evidence from randomized trials in cardiac surgery populations supports specific interventions to protect or prevent AKI, recent reports indicate reduced AKI associated with some procedural innovations, and the hope that promising findings for agents such as sodium bicarbonate that require further study may yield effective therapies. Summary: The vexing problem of AKI following cardiac surgery is common and unsolved. Clinical strategies that stress avoidance rather than treatment remain the mainstay of effective management of patients at high renal risk."

9,Nutritional assessment and support in acute kidney injury.,"Purpose of review: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the ICU is associated with an increased risk of protein-energy wasting (PEW), a major negative prognostic factor. This review illustrates recently published data and guidelines concerning nutritional problems in AKI, pointing out complexities and peculiarities of the syndrome. Recent findings: The main goals of nutritional support in AKI on renal replacement therapy (RRT) are to ensure the provision of adequate amounts of nutrients, to prevent PEW, to promote tissue reparation, to support the immune system, and possibly to reduce mortality. The enteral route should be preferred, even though parenteral nutrition is often required to target nutritional needs. Special attention should be paid both to the impact of RRT on macronutrient and micronutrient losses, and to the risk of complications. In fact, due to both the acute loss of the kidneys' homeostatic function, and the frequent need of RRT, patients with AKI are especially prone to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, fluid balance alterations, electrolyte and acid-base derangements. Summary: This review highlights the most recent concepts and recommendations for nutritional support in AKI, stressing the need for a close integration between adequate nutrition and RRT in this clinical condition, with the aim of carefully tailoring both therapies on patients' changing needs. Recent findings about the renoprotective role of some nutrients (glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids) are also discussed."
