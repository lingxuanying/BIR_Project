0,Potential interventions in sepsis-related acute kidney injury.,"Sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury often complicates sepsis, leading to greater complexity, cost of care, and worsening prognosis. In recent years, a consensus definition of acute kidney injury has been developed, facilitating research into the pathophysiology and epidemiology of this disorder. New and emerging biomarkers to recognize kidney injury before functional abnormalities are manifest may allow early recognition and facilitate prevention or treatment. Furthermore, advances in the clinical management of sepsis may have secondary benefits with respect to renal outcomes. Existing and hybrid extracorporeal therapies are being investigated not only as means to replace lost kidney function but also to modulate the immune response to sepsis. For those who have more advanced forms of kidney injury, strategies to promote renal recovery are being sought to minimize the long-term consequences of impaired kidney function. This review provides an update on the current state of the science and a glimpse toward the future of intervention in sepsis-related acute kidney injury."

2,Comparison of acute kidney injury of different etiology reveals in-common mechanisms of tissue damage.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome of reduced glomerular filtration rate and urine production caused by a number of different diseases. It is associated with renal tissue damage. This tissue damage can cause tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis that leads to nephron loss and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review describes the in-common mechanisms behind tissue damage in AKI caused by different underlying diseases. Comparing six high-quality microarray studies of renal gene expression after AKI in disease models (gram-negative sepsis, gram-positive sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion, malignant hypertension, rhabdomyolysis, and cisplatin toxicity) identified 5,254 differentially expressed genes in at least one of the AKI models; 66% of genes were found only in one model, showing that there are unique features to AKI depending on the underlying disease. There were in-common features in the form of four genes that were differentially expressed in all six models, 49 in at least five, and 215 were found in common between at least four models. Gene ontology enrichment analysis could be broadly categorized into the injurious processes hypoxia, oxidative stress, and inflammation, as well as the cellular outcomes of cell death and tissue remodeling in the form of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Pathway analysis showed that MYC is a central connection in the network of activated genes in-common to AKI, which suggests that it may be a central regulator of renal gene expression in tissue injury during AKI. The outlining of this molecular network may be useful for understanding progression from AKI to CKD."
3,Acute kidney injury in 2010: Advances in diagnosis and estimating disease prognosis.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication associated with morbidity and mortality. Studies from 2010 have provided insights into the diagnosis and clinical course of AKI, the ability of novel biomarkers to guide therapy, and the quality of life of survivors of severe AKI. It is hoped that these findings will lead to improvements in the diagnosis and prognosis of affected individuals."

5,The growth of acute kidney injury: a rising tide or just closer attention to detail?,"Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously termed acute renal failure, is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and accelerated chronic kidney disease (CKD). Over the past 2 decades, dramatic rises in the incidences of AKI have been reported, particularly within the United States. The question arises as to whether these changes reflect actual increases in disease incidence, or are potentially explained by the introduction of consensus definitions that rely on small standardized changes in serum creatinine, changes in coding and reimbursement, or increasingly available and more liberal use of dialysis. In this review, we explore the secular trends in AKI incidence in North America and Western Europe and its potential contributors."

7,Review article: Acute kidney injury in critical illness.,"Purpose: This review provides a focused and comprehensive update on emerging evidence related to acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal findings: Acute kidney injury is a significant clinical problem that increasingly complicates the course of hospitalization and portends worse clinical outcome for sick hospitalized patients. The recent introduction of consensus criteria for the diagnosis of AKI (i.e., RIFLE/AKIN classification) have greatly improved our capacity not only to standardize the diagnosis and classification of severity of AKI, but also to facilitate conducting comparative epidemiologic studies in an effort to better understand the burden of adult and pediatric AKI and its syndromes (i.e., septic, cardio-renal, hepato-renal). The characterization of several novel AKI-specific biomarkers (i.e., neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule-1, and interleukin-18) is extending our understanding of the pathophysiology of AKI. Moreover, these biomarkers appear to have clinical relevance for early detection and they provide prognostic value. These innovations are aiding in the design of epidemiologic surveys and randomized trials of therapeutic interventions. Strategies for prevention and conservative management of AKI across a range of clinical settings are discussed, including sepsis, hepato-renal syndrome, cardio-renal syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and in the perioperative setting. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury is an escalating clinical problem in hospitalized patients. Recent advances in AKI have improved knowledge of its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis; however, considerable research effort is needed. There are still relatively few interventions proven to alter the natural history of established AKI in hospitalized settings, and its development foretells less favourable outcomes."
8,"Acute kidney injury: new concepts in definition, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly recognized in all fields of medical practice. Unfortunately, this syndrome has been plagued by inconsistent definitions, simplistic pathophysiologic schemas, and insensitive diagnostic tools. Recent advances in defining AKI, understanding its pathophysiology, and improving the diagnostic accuracy of the testing tools available eventually will impact disease management and clinical outcomes. Prompt recognition and treatment of AKI remain the cornerstone of clinical management for this high-mortality, high-cost syndrome. The authors provide the most recent updates in the definition, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment options for patients with AKI, providing a stepwise approach to clinical evaluation for use in all fields of medical practice."
9,Novel risk factors for acute kidney injury.,"Purpose of review: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious problem. Understanding an individual patient's risk profile may offer opportunities for prevention or early intervention. The aim of this review is to describe novel nontraditional risk factors. Recent findings: The risk of AKI is determined by patient factors and nephrotoxic exposures. Hyperuricaemia, obesity, hypoalbuminaemia and certain genetic polymorphism have been found to be associated with an increased susceptibility to AKI, especially in surgical patients. However, there is no convincing evidence that albumin replacement or uric acid lowering ameliorates the risk. Genetic predisposition contributes to AKI in general and also drug-nephrotoxicity. The exact relationship between obesity and AKI has not been fully understood.Patients exposed to starches, chloride-rich fluids or mechanical ventilation have an increased risk of AKI. Starches in particular should be avoided in high-risk patients. Although chloride-rich fluids are associated with AKI based on observational studies, direct proof of harm is lacking. Summary: Novel risk factors for AKI have been identified but more work is necessary to investigate the nature of the association. There is no evidence that correction of hyperuricaemia or hypoalbuminaemia is beneficial but high-risk exposures should be avoided in patients at risk of AKI."
