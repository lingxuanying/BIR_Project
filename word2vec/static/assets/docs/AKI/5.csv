0,Acute Kidney Injury in the Critically Ill Patient: A Current Review of the Literature.,"Purpose: A comprehensive review of the literature to provide a focused and thorough update on the issue of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the surgical patient. Methods: A PubMed and Medline search was performed and keywords included AKI, renal failure, critically ill, and renal replacement therapy (RRT). Principal findings: A common clinical problem encountered in critically ill patients is AKI. The recent consensus definitions for the diagnosis and classification of AKI (ie, Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease/Acute Kidney Injury Network) have enabled us to standardize the severity of AKI and facilitate strategies for prevention. These strategies as well as treatment modalities of AKI are discussed. We provide a concise overview of the issue of renal failure. We describe strategies for prevention including types of fluids used for resuscitation, timing of initiation of RRT, and different treatment modalities currently available for clinical practice. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury is a common problem in the critically ill patient and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. A standardized definition and staging system has led to improved diagnosis and understanding of the pathophysiology of AKI. There are many trials leading to improved prevention and management of the disease."
1,Acute kidney injury: lessons from experimental models.,"For decades severe tubular necrosis has been the hallmark of experimental models of acute renal failure (ARF), such as prolonged ischemia and reflow. This fits well with the still widely used traditional clinical term 'acute tubular necrosis'. Nevertheless, the rareness of tubular necrosis in human kidney biopsies in the background of hypoxic, toxic and septic AKI led to the adoption of a new term, 'acute kidney injury' (AKI), which refers to such clinical scenarios irrespective of the renal morphology. Indeed, experimental AKI models, which have more limited acute renal parenchymal compromise, underscore the focal and regional tissue injury patterns that range from adaptive stress response, through cellular dysfunction, apoptotic cell death and frank acute tubular necrosis. Such stress and injury patterns, short of necrosis, may go unnoticed morphologically and even functionally, and may even confer resistance to subsequent insults. Herein we describe the spectrum of what we call 'sublethal injury', referring to a condition, which by itself is insufficient to produce cellular death, but may or may not produce organ failure. Such sublethal injury can be detected by overt morphological changes, by the upregulation of cell survival factors, and by recently developed biomarkers and imaging techniques of organ physiology and dysfunction. The use of combined sublethal insults in animal models is an attempt to replicate the clinical situation of comorbidities, a circumstance which underlies most situations of AKI. This review will discuss the definition of such sublethal injury and the modes of its detection."
2,Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury develops in up to 30% of patients who undergo cardiac surgery, with up to 3% of patients requiring dialysis. The requirement for dialysis after cardiac surgery is associated with an increased risk of infection, prolonged stay in critical care units and long-term need for dialysis. The development of acute kidney injury is independently associated with substantial short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Its pathogenesis involves multiple pathways. Haemodynamic, inflammatory, metabolic and nephrotoxic factors are involved and overlap each other leading to kidney injury. Clinical studies have identified predictors for cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury that can be used effectively to determine the risk for acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. High-risk patients can be targeted for renal protective strategies. Nonetheless, there is little compelling evidence from randomized trials supporting specific interventions to protect or prevent acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery patients. Several strategies have shown some promise, including less invasive procedures in those at greatest risk, natriuretic peptide, fenoldopam, preoperative hydration, preoperative optimization of anaemia and postoperative early use of renal replacement therapy. The efficacy of larger-scale trials remains to be confirmed."
3,[Acute kidney injury is a common and serious condition. The clinical significance is great and probably underestimated].,"Acute kidney injury, previously called acute renal failure, is very common in different health care settings. Acute kidney injury is strongly related to an increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, heart failure and dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. The established classification of acute kidney injury, KDIGO, uses changes in serum creatinine values, and/or urine output to define different stages (stages 1-3). Acute kidney injury stage 1 is defined as an increase in serum creatinine levels of 26 Î¼mol/l, or an 1.5-2-fold increase in serum creatinine levels compared with baseline values, which often goes undetected. The aim of this review was to give an overview of the classification, epidemiology, and importance of acute kidney injury for prognosis in different clinical settings."

6,Acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI), a recognized complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (15-30%) with approximately 1% of all the affected patients requiring dialysis. Early detection of AKI would enable intervention before occurrence of irreversible injury and might minimize the morbidity and mortality. Recently developed biomarkers of AKI facilitate its earlier discovery and help assessment of its severity and prognosis. In this article, we review the causes of well-known yet inexplicable association between CPB and AKI, the advances in pathophysiologic basis, the diagnostics and the management options."

8,Expanding the Role for Kidney Biopsies in Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly heterogeneous, common, and potentially devastating condition associated with markedly increased hospital length of stay, cost, mortality, and morbidity. Expanding the role for kidney biopsies in AKI may offer fresh insights into disease heterogeneity, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic targets. A number of challenges face investigators and clinicians considering research biopsies in AKI: ensuring patient safety, ensuring the ethical conduct of research studies, and maximizing the scientific yield of the kidney tissue obtained. The societal benefits of research that lead to novel strategies for preventing and treating AKI would be enormous. Rethinking our current approach to the role of kidney biopsy for AKI diagnosis and research may be a major step toward the promise of personalized medicine in nephrology."
