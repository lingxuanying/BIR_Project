2,Acute kidney injury: turning the tide.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with sepsis remains an all too common occurrence with an associated high mortality rate. However, recent developments bring hope that this scenario may be changing. This change is being brought about by a multi-pronged approach that highlights several different but inter-related aspects of AKI. These include: (1) defining a standard definition for AKI; (2) understanding the importance of early recognition of AKI; (3) improving imaging techniques for the diagnosis of AKI; (4) improved understanding of the complex pathogenesis of AKI, especially in sepsis; (5) the development of targeted strategies to prevent and treat AKI and (6) an improved understanding of the design and implementation of clinical trials in AKI. Through advances in all of these areas it is hoped that the incidence and mortality rates associated with AKI will be improved."

4,Radiocontrast Toxicity.,"Intravenous and intraarterial contrast media are invaluable tools in the diagnosis of anatomic lesions. However, they have been associated with deleterious renal events, ranging from acute kidney injury (iodinated contrast) to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (gadolinium-containing agents). Contrast-associated acute kidney injury has a wide incidence, likely due to differences in populations studied, with incidence likely overstated due to comorbid conditions at the time of contrast exposure. Pathophysiology includes hemodynamic and direct toxic effects. Preventative strategies include intravenous saline administration, higher urine pH, and statin administration. Importantly, because of fears of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, practitioners may be selecting only the healthiest patients for contrast exposure. Gadolinium-based contrast agents may cause their toxicity through being unbound from their ligand, and certain preparations may be less harmful than others."

6,Acute kidney injury: how do we define it?,"Over recent years, there has been welcome increased interest in acute kidney injury (AKI) and its association with patient outcome. The term AKI has replaced the term acute renal failure (ARF) and encompasses all types of ARF. New definitions and staging systems for AKI have been proposed, which have stimulated a multitude of different studies to evaluate their clinical utility. These recent advances need to be communicated to the wider health care community so that we are using a shared nomenclature. In 2009 the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death AKI study ('Adding Insult to Injury') announced its findings and recommendations. The report recommended that the detection of AKI and its management should be improved. These recommendations along with the adoption of the new staging systems will potentially have an impact on clinical biochemistry departments and exert an increased demand on resources. Running in parallel with these initiatives is the quest to discover novel biomarkers to detect AKI, the development and introduction of which will require laboratory support."
