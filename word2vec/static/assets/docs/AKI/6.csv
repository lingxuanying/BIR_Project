0,Acute kidney injury: classification and staging.,"It was not until recently that consensus definitions for acute kidney injury (AKI) were proposed and published. The RIFLE (Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End-stage renal disease) and AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) classifications were designed in order to be easily understood and applied in a variety of clinical and research settings. Their creation was intended to uniformly establish the presence or absence of the AKI and to give a quantitative idea of the severity of the disease unifying the commonly used parameters of serum creatinine and urine output. Subsequent validation showed that both the presence and severity of AKI, defined using RIFLE/AKIN, correlate well with patient outcome. This review will briefly describe the RIFLE/AKIN consensus definitions, its subsequent revisions and its successful validation and application to clinical research. The potential of extending the use of RIFLE/AKIN to the clinical setting of cardiorenal syndromes is also discussed."
1,Care of the Acute Kidney Injury Survivor.,"While the short-term implications of acute kidney injury (AKI) have been known for many years, far less attention has been paid to the health of AKI survivors. This was perhaps fueled by a prevailing wisdom that if a patient was fortunate enough to survive the primary illness associated with AKI, the prognosis for future health was auspicious. More recently, this dogma was challenged by data suggesting that after an episode of AKI, patients remain at risk of experiencing multiple adverse health outcomes. Greater recognition and appreciation of the risks faced by AKI survivors have led to the development of quality improvement initiatives that are supposed to enrich this vulnerable population."

3,[Acute kidney injury--recovery--which patients and why?].,"Acute kidney injury occurs in up to 30% of all ICU patients. Renal replacement therapy is required in approx. 8%, and mortality in the latter group is up to 50%. Dialysis dependency occurs in 10-30% of survivors. Risk factors for non-recovery are baseline kidney disease, advanced age, and sepsis-induced kidney failure. Even in those with initial recovery the subsequent risk of chronic renal failure is high. Specific interventions to promote renal-recovery are not available. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that if continuous renal replacement therapies are used instead of intermittent haemodialysis the chance of recovery to independence from dialysis is increased."
4,"Drug-Induced Nephrotoxicity: Pathogenic Mechanisms, Biomarkers and Prevention Strategies.","Background: Risk factors of drug-induced nephrotoxicity include drug overdose, drug-drug interactions and drug-related adverse effects. Since the usage of some nephrotoxic drugs is still unavoidable in the clinical setting, understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of their nephrotoxicities is critical to decrease the incidence of kidney injury. Early detection of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and reduction of the therapeutic side effects are realistic approaches to avoid the end stage of renal failure. Method: In this review, we summarized the mechanisms and prevention strategies for some drugs that were commonly used clinically and had the possibility of inducing acute and chronic kidney injuries. We discussed the advantages and drawbacks of currently available biomarkers for indicating kidney impairment. In vitro and pre-clinical in vivo models for assessing the nephrotoxicity during the drug developmental stages were also evaluated. Results: Nowadays, an increasing number of biomarkers were discovered for the early diagnosis of kidney injury. In addition, various kinds of in vitro and pre-clinical in vivo models were developed and utilized to minimize the potential nephrotoxicity during the drug development. Conclusion: The discovery of the early biomarkers and development of accurate diagnostic methods are effective prevention strategies for drug-induced kidney impairment."
5,"Acute kidney injury in low- and middle-income countries: investigations, management and prevention.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a relatively common condition, encountered in everyday paediatric clinical practice. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children both inside and outside intensive care units. It is associated with prolonged hospital stay and progression to chronic kidney disease. The burden of AKI is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries where rural areas and smaller cities in the countryside predominate. Most of these areas suffer from poverty, poor sanitation, water quality and hygiene, lack of education and poor access to health care. AKI is preventable if it is detected sufficiently early and managed promptly. Improved nephrology services and the availability of cost-effective dialysis facilities in resource-limited settings should reduce morbidity and save many children's lives."

7,Acute kidney injury post neonatal asphyxia.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common consequence of perinatal asphyxia, occurring in up to 56% of these infants. A major difficulty in diagnosing this condition is the lack of a consensus definition of neonatal AKI, largely because of a dearth of specific measurable variables and biochemical markers. This review will discuss the current evidence regarding the epidemiology, investigation, and treatment of AKI in the asphyxiated neonate. Particular emphasis will be given to the investigation of renal function in the neonate and to potential biomarkers that may aid the clinician in the diagnosis of renal injury in this population."
8,Acute kidney injury: epidemiology and diagnostic criteria.,"Purpose of review: To review recent advances in the definitions and diagnostic criteria for acute renal failure and acute kidney injury. To explore how these changes impact the epidemiology and clinical implications for patients in the intensive care unit. Recent findings: Recently published consensus criteria for the definition of acute renal failure/acute kidney injury have led to significant changes in how we think about this disorder. Studies from around the world, both in and out of the intensive care unit, have shown a dramatic incidence of acute kidney injury and high associated mortality. This review considers these new findings and their historical context, and attempts to shed new light on this old problem. Summary: Small changes in kidney function in hospitalized patients are important and impact on outcome. RIFLE criteria provide a uniform definition of acute kidney injury and are increasingly used in literature."
9,Why are patients still getting and dying from acute kidney injury?,"Purpose of review: Acute kidney injury is common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Rates of acute kidney injury in most settings remain high and in some settings are increasing. Moreover, outcomes associated with acute kidney injury remain relatively poor. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding of acute kidney injury and discusses possible interventions based on these advances. Recent findings: Acute kidney injury is not a disease with a single etiology and clinical course but rather a loose collection of syndromes whose unifying phenotype is an acute loss of glomerular filtration. Traditional taxonomy based on anatomic locations (pre, intra, and post) in reference to the kidney is overly simplistic and has given way to specific 'endotypes' including hepatorenal, cardiorenal, nephrotoxic, and sepsis-associated and these syndromes all have unique pathophysiologies and treatments. Our tendency to lump all of these clinical syndromes into a single disease and seek a single treatment has led to the profound lack of progress observed in terms of improving outcomes. The hope is that this is about to change. Summary: Understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology of acute kidney injury is critical to achieving improved outcomes for the millions of patients who develop this loose constellation of syndromes."
