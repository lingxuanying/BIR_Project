1,Renal regeneration after acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury is common and associated with negative renal and patient outcomes. The human kidney has a real but limited regeneration capacity. Understanding renal regeneration may allow us to manipulate this process and thus develop therapeutic weapons to improve patients' outcome. In the first part of this paper we discuss the clinical factors associated with renal recovery: baseline patient particularities, acute kidney injury characteristics and the medical approach taken in the short and long-term. In the second part, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying renal regeneration are explored. The immune system seems to have an important role, first promoting inflammation and then tissue healing. Other players, such as cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, renal haemodynamics and metabolic reprogramming also have a role in renal regeneration. We aim to develop a short review of renal regeneration, offering a holistic view of this process."
2,Acute kidney injury in pregnancy including renal disease diagnosed in pregnancy.,"Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury (AKI) is a rare but serious complication in high-income settings and remains an important cause of maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income settings. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the leading cause of pregnancy-related AKI worldwide. In this article, we outline the epidemiology, aetiology, recognition, investigation and management of pregnancy-related AKI. Difficulties in the definition of AKI, approaches to determine the cause of AKI in diagnostically challenging circumstances and diagnosis of new renal disease in pregnancy are discussed."
3,Acute kidney injury and disease: Long-term consequences and management.,"With increasing longevity and the presence of multiple comorbidities, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients, and an even larger population in the community, is at increased risk of developing an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI). Because of improvements in short-term outcomes following an episode of AKI, survivors of an episode of AKI are now predisposed to develop its long-term sequel. The identification of risk for progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is complicated by the absence of good biomarkers that identify this risk and the variability of risk associated with clinical factors including, but not limited to, the number of AKI episodes, severity, duration of previous AKI and pre-existing CKD that has made the prediction for long-term outcomes in survivors of AKI more difficult. Being a significant contributor to the growing incidence of CKD, there is a need to implement measures to prevent AKI in both the community and hospital settings, target interventions to treat AKI that are also associated with better long-term outcomes, accurately identify patients at risk of adverse consequences following an episode of AKI and institute therapeutic strategies to improve these long-term outcomes. We discuss the lasting renal and non-renal consequences following an episode of AKI, available biomarkers and non-invasive testing to identify ongoing intra-renal pathology and review the currently available and future treatment strategies to help reduce these adverse long-term outcomes."
4,Acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery.,"Purpose of review: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a long-recognized complication of cardiac surgery. It is a commonly encountered clinical syndrome that, in its most severe form, increases the odds of operative mortality three to eight-fold. The pathogenesis of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is complex. No single intervention is likely to provide a panacea, and thus, the purpose of this review is to assess the wide breadth of emerging research into potential strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat CSA-AKI. Recent findings: Research in the field of CSA-AKI published within the last 18 months adds further layers of knowledge to many previously studied areas. These include its definition (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease, Acute Kidney Injury Network, and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria), diagnosis (biomarkers and intraoperative renal oximetry), prevention (statin therapy, acetylsalicylic acid, N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, off-pump coronary revascularization, goal-directed hemodynamic therapy, and minimizing blood transfusion), and treatment (early initiation of renal replacement therapy). Summary: Although there has been much high-quality research conducted in this field in recent years, preventing CSA-AKI by avoiding renal insults remains the mainstay of management. Although biomarkers have the potential to diagnose CSA-AKI at an earlier stage, efficacious interventions to treat established CSA-AKI remain elusive."
5,Acute kidney injury in the elderly.,"Most patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) are older than 65 years. Specific structural and functional changes that occur in the aging kidney predispose the elderly patient to AKI. This risk is further compounded by comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, and the need for invasive procedures. When AKI does occur, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although morbidity and mortality increases with advancing age, many elderly patients can survive AKI and do well. Thus, decision making should be thoughtful and individualized, and not dependent on age. Whenever possible, preventive approaches should be pursued to lessen the burden of AKI."
6,Acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) - an abrupt deterioration in renal function - causes a rise in serum creatinine (SCr) or fall in urine output. It is common, occurring in up to 20% of hospital admissions. Importantly, even small rises in SCr are associated with increased risk of death and longer hospital stays. A 2009 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report found that a proportion of AKI in secondary care was avoidable. In addition, management of established AKI was 'good' less than half the time. In practice, AKI represents a heterogeneous group of conditions, encompassing impairments in both kidney structure and function. Delivering disease-specific treatment early in the course of AKI may improve outcomes. The provision of best-practice care for all will rely on a better understanding of risk, and frameworks of care that can be applied across a diverse patient group."

8,Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiology: From Recognition to Intervention.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common among hospitalized patients, and the incidence of AKI has increased over the past few decades. This increase might be due to an aging population and increased comorbidities. Other factors that may explain this are the more sensitive diagnostic criteria and better recognition. AKI is associated with increased mortality and increased risks of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. The best ways to lower the chances of having kidney damage are to prevent, recognize and treat AKI as early as possible. The incidence of AKI in China is significantly lower than in developed countries. Inadequate early diagnosis and management remain the major challenges for Chinese nephrologists."
9,Acute kidney injury: an overview of pathophysiology and treatments.,"Acute kidney injury, or acute kidney failure, is thought to complicate 5% of hospital admissions (Cheung, Ponnusamy, & Anderton, 2008). Most healthcare providers are likely to encounter patients experiencing acute kidney injury. Nurses and other healthcare professionals can play a vital role in identifying patients at risk for acute kidney injury and aid early intervention by identifying decreased kidney function. This article summarizes the current literature on acute kidney injury, including the definition, pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnostic tests, and current treatments and interventions."
