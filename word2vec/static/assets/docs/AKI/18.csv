4,Using RIFLE criteria to evaluate acute kidney injury in brain-deceased kidney donors.,"Background: The limited supply of deceased donors for renal transplantation led to considering alternative strategies for making more organs available. One of these strategies is the use of donors with renal dysfunction, as this is usually a reversible condition. RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss and end-stage renal failure) criteria were developed to standardize the definition and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) but have not been previously used in brain-deceased donors. We applied the RIFLE classification to evaluate renal function changes in our donor pool, in an attempt to know its influence in transplant outcome. Methods: Data were collected from the renal transplant patient and the intensive care unit brain-dead donors prospectively maintained databases of our hospital. Risk was defined when creatinine increased x1.5, injury when it increased x2 and failure when last creatinine increased x3 with respect to admission-day creatinine. Results: From 176 donors, 10.8% suffered AKI and 7.9% were included in 'risk', 2.3% in 'injury' and 0.6% in 'failure' categories. There were no significant differences between AKI and non-AKI groups in donor and intensive care management variables, except in last-day creatinine. First-day urine volumes were lower (P = 0.043) and delayed graft function rates were higher (P = 0.013) in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group recipients. Graft survival and other outcome variables were not different between AKI and non-AKI recipients. Conclusions: The RIFLE classification system offers us an opportunity to standardize and quantify renal injury in donors. Although >10% of brain-deceased donors can suffer AKI, these grafts can perform adequately. Hence, the development of AKI in donors cannot be an isolated criterion to discard kidney donation."
5,Prevention of severe acute kidney injury by implementation of care bundles: Some progress but still a lot of work ahead.,"Routine health data, dating from 1990 to 2015, show a dramatic rise in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the general population and an apparent increase in acute dialysis (AKI-D) prompting calls for improvement of care in AKI patients. Recent reports suggest flattening of population-based AKI occurrence rates or declining frequencies of AKI or AKI-D in subgroups of high-risk patients with known onset of AKI. These temporal changes in AKI occurrence relate at least in part to the widespread implementation of AKI prevention care bundles. Nevertheless, AKI frequencies and AKI morbidity and mortality remain high. Incorporation of real-time electronic alerts and the use of novel biomarkers in high-risk patients or patients with known onset of AKI may result in further reductions of AKI incidences by early recognition of AKI and by timely conservative management of AKI. There is an urgent need for further treatment options of established AKI."
