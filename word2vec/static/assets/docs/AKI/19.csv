0,"Prevention, detection and management of acute kidney injury: concise guideline.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is considered a silent disease that commonly occurs in patients with acute illness; however, given that it has few specific symptoms and signs in its early stages, detection can be delayed. AKI can also occur in patients with no obvious acute illness or secondary to more rare causes. In both these scenarios, patients are often under the care of specialists outside of nephrology, who might fail to detect that AKI is developing and might not be familiar with its optimum management. Therefore, there is a need to increase the awareness of AKI among many different healthcare specialists. In this article, we summarise the key recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) AKI guideline. The guideline provides recommendations for adult and paediatric patients on the prevention, early detection and management of AKI, as well as information on AKI and sources of support. Implementation of this guideline will contribute to improving patient safety and saving lives."
1,New insights in acute kidney failure in the critically ill.,"The term acute kidney injury (AKI) has been recently coined by a large panel of international experts in place of the former expression ""acute renal failure"". This change has been motivated by a double intention: first it served to definitely find a conventional definition for acute changes of renal function, previously lacking in the medical community. In fact, any attempt to compare scientific papers and different centres experiences on AKI was essentially impossible. The second aim was to remark that this syndrome is characterised by a spectrum of progressive damage, from mild creatinine increase to renal injury to a more severe form, failure: this important concept should increase clinicians awareness to every form of renal dysfunction, even milder ones, in order to improve epidemiologic analyses, potentially preventing eventual AKI progression and finally helping standardisation of medical and supportive therapy. This review will describe such ""new era"" of critical care nephrology by presenting current literature (and its many controversies) about AKI diagnosis, physiopathology and management."

5,[Review of the knowledge on acute kidney failure in the critical patient].,"Acute renal failure affects from 1% to 25% of patients admitted to intensive care units. These figures vary depending on the population studied and criteria. The complications of acute renal failure (fluid overload, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, bleeding) are treated. However, mortality remains high despite the technological advances of recent years because acute renal failure is usually associated with sepsis, respiratory failure, serious injury, surgical complications or consumption coagulopathy. Mortality ranges from 30% to 90%. Although there is no universally accepted definition, the RIFLE classification gives us an operational tool to define the degree of acute renal failure and to standardize the initiation of renal replacement techniques as well as to evaluate the results. Therefore, nurses working within the intensive care unit must be familiar with this disease, with its treatment (drug or alternative) and with the prevention of possible complications. Equally, they must be capable of detecting the manifestations of dependency each one of the basic needs and to be able to identify the collaboration problems in order to achieve an individualized care plan."
6,Acute kidney dysfunction and the critically ill.,"Given the devastating effect that acute kidney dysfunction (AKD) has on the clinical course and outcome of critically ill patients, it is incumbent on every intensive care provider to understand the causes and effects of AKD. AKD is common and costly and even mild forms warrant attention. Promising new therapies are being explored. But even after they arrive, attention to first principles of avoiding further injury from volume depletion, hypotension and nephrotoxins will be of the primary concern of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) team. For established AKD, more and possibly sooner renal replacement therapy is likely to be better than less and later."

9,Acute Renal Failure in Critically Ill Patients: Current Evidence-Based Practices.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition amongst critically ill patients in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There are several areas of ongoing debate regarding management of AKI, specifically the initiation and timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT). In this review, we aim to concisely discuss epidemiology, current evidence with regards to optimal vascular access, timing of initiation and modality of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury in critically ill patients."
