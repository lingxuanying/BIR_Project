1,Future care planning: a first step to palliative care for all patients with advanced heart disease.,"Palliative care is recommended for patients with end-stage heart failure with several recent, randomised trials showing improvements in symptoms and quality of life and more studies underway. Future care planning provides a framework for discussing a range of palliative care problems with patients and their families. This approach can be introduced at any time during the patient's journey of care and ideally well in advance of end-of-life care. Future care planning is applicable to a wide range of patients with advanced heart disease and could be delivered systematically by cardiology teams at the time of an unplanned hospital admission, akin to cardiac rehabilitation for myocardial infarction. Integrating cardiology care and palliative care can benefit many patients with advanced heart disease at increased risk of death or hospitalisation. Larger, randomised trials are needed to assess the impact on patient outcomes and experiences."
2,Almanac 2012: Congenital Heart Disease. The National Society Journals Present selected research that has driven recent advances in clinical cardiology.,"This Almanac highlights recent papers on congenital heart disease in the major cardiac journals. Over 100 articles are cited. Subheadings are used to group relevant papers and allow readers to focus on their areas of interest, but are not meant to be comprehensive for all aspects of congenital cardiac disease."
3,Systemic sclerosis and the heart.,"Heart disease, either clinically apparent or silent, is a frequent complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) and may affect both patients with diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous SSc. The availability of more sensitive modalities has led to an increased awareness of scleroderma heart disease, which often involves the pericardium, myocardium, and cardiac conduction system. This awareness of cardiac involvement requires attention and interventions led by internists, cardiologists, and rheumatologists. Although no specific therapy exists for scleroderma heart disease, early recognition of the presence and type of scleroderma heart disease may lead to more effective management of patients with scleroderma."

5,Application of stress echocardiography to the evaluation of non-coronary heart disease.,"Stress echocardiography is accepted as a routine test in patients with coronary artery disease for the identification of myocardial ischaemia, the diagnosis of viable myocardium and assessment of prognosis. This review addresses the application of the test to non-coronary heart diseases. Some caution should be applied to the use of stress echocardiography for the detection of ischaemia in patients with valvular heart disease. However, examination of haemodynamics and left ventricular function during exercise is worthwhile in the assessment of symptomatic patients with apparently mild or moderate valvular disease, as well as being useful for the detection of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction. In the future, this tool may be more widely applied to the identification of other 'subclinical' conditions, including pulmonary hypertension, anthracycline cardiotoxicity and valvular heart diseases, although the benefit of early diagnosis of these conditions remains to be established."
6,Anxiety and psychological management of heart disease and heart surgery.,"Anxiety is associated with many forms and facets of heart disease, and, by extension, neurologic manifestations of heart disease. Despite its seeming self-evidence, anxiety is challenging to consistently define, measure, and operationalize in the context of medical research. Various diagnostic nosologies have been defined and refined over time, but anxiety is also a universal human experience that may be ""normal"" in many circumstances, particularly in the face of major medical issues. For these and other reasons, the research on anxiety and heart disease is mixed, incomplete, and often characterized by challenging questions of causality. Nonetheless, a broad body of literature has established clear connections between anxiety and vascular risk factors, cardiac disease, and cardiac surgery. These relationships are often intuitive, with research suggesting, for example, that chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system is associated with increased risk of heart disease. However, they are sometimes complexly reciprocal or even surprising (e.g., with high-anxiety individuals found to have better outcomes in some cardiac conditions by virtue of seeking evaluation and treatment earlier). This chapter reviews the construct of anxiety and its complexities, its associations with heart disease, and the established treatments for anxiety, concluding with questions about anxiety, heart disease, and their optimal management that still need to be answered."
7,MicroRNAs: powerful new regulators of heart disease and provocative therapeutic targets.,"MicroRNAs act as negative regulators of gene expression by inhibiting the translation or promoting the degradation of target mRNAs. Recent studies have revealed key roles of microRNAs as regulators of the growth, development, function, and stress responsiveness of the heart, providing glimpses of undiscovered regulatory mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of heart disease."
