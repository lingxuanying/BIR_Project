0,Management of cardiac emergencies in children.,"Children with heart disease may present to the Emergency Department in many stages of life, with a range of cardiovascular manifestions, from minimally irritating palpitations to the life-threatening derangements of shock or lethal dysrhythmia. Cardiac emergencies are rare in children in comparison to adults. The pathophysiology differs: ischemic heart disease is virtually unknown, whereas most cases occur secondary to congenital heart disease. Their successful management requires an accurate diagnosis and timely interventions to achieve optimal outcomes in this heterogeneous and complex patient population. The diagnosis, however, is not always straightforward, as evidenced by the non-specific clinical picture that can be presented by pediatric heart diseases. This article reviews pertinent issues concerning diagnosis and management of cardiac disorders with which children present to the emergency department. The initial diagnostic and specific therapeutic approach to these patients will be discussed."

2,New concepts regarding events that lead to end-stage heart disease.,"Cardiac dysfunction is a progressive process that eventuates in end-stage heart failure. This progression involves dilatation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle, characterized as left ventricular remodeling. This remodeling results in a falling left ventricular ejection fraction, worsening heart failure, and increased risk of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Increased aortic impedance due to vasoconstriction, neurohormonal stimulation, and bioenergetic abnormalities all may contribute to the remodeling process. Therapeutic efforts aimed at halting this progressive process, especially if initiated early in the course of the disease, are most likely to exert a favorable effect."
3,Using Cardiac Biomarkers in Veterinary Practice.,"Blood-based assays for various cardiac biomarkers can assist in the diagnosis of heart disease in dogs and cats. The two most common markers are cardiac troponin-I and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Biomarker assays can assist in differentiating cardiac from noncardiac causes of respiratory signs and detection of preclinical cardiomyopathy. Increasingly, studies indicate that cardiac biomarker testing can help assess the risk of morbidity and mortality in animals with heart disease. Usage of cardiac biomarker testing in clinical practice relies on proper patient selection, correct interpretation of test results, and incorporation of biomarker testing into existing diagnostic methods."
4,The burden of physical inactivity & cardiovascular heart disease.,"Heart disease exacts a tremendous toll each year in mortality and health care expenditures. Although physical activity reduces the risk of heart disease, the population remains inactive. The importance of physical activity in risk and health care cost reduction is discussed."

6,"Women's magazine coverage of heart disease risk factors: Good Housekeeping magazine, 1997 to 2007.","Women, who often turn to magazines for health information, continue to underestimate their risk for heart disease, though it remains the leading cause of death among women in the United States. This textual analysis considered the portrayal of women's risk factors for heart disease as problem and remedy frames within articles published by the highest circulation women's magazine in the U.S., Good Housekeeping, from 1997 to 2007. These findings were then compared with corresponding information endorsed by the American Heart Association. Far from underestimating a woman's risk for heart disease, GH articles seemed to target women at low risk for heart disease, while emphasizing risk factors unique to women. The magazine coverage was largely consistent with American Heart Association information, yet offered a broader range of treatment and prevention strategies that were sometimes contradictory or vague. One significant risk factor, race, was not mentioned in the magazine articles. This review calls for future research to determine the pervasiveness and possible effects of such coverage."
