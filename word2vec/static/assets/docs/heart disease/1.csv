0,Heart Disease in Children.,"The pediatric cardiology field has developed rapidly over the past few decades. More children than ever born with congenital heart disease (CHD) are growing into adulthood. Primary care providers play a key role in diagnosis, management, and referral of children with CHD because many common cardiac complaints (eg, feeding intolerance, cyanosis, chest pain, palpitations, and syncope) are first addressed in the primary care setting. The spectrum of heart disease in children ranges from common complaints to complex single-ventricle physiology, acute myocarditis, and heart transplantation. This article reviews the pathophysiology and management of the most frequent cardiac conditions encountered in primary care."
1,Heart disease in pregnancy.,"Cardiac disease is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the developed world. The majority of women with heart disease are able to successfully undergo pregnancy. However, in women with severely impaired ventricular function, severe left heart obstruction, pulmonary hypertension and aortopathy, such as Marfan syndrome, with significant aortic dilatation, pregnancy is associated with a significant risk, and these women should be counselled against pregnancy if there is no option for treatment that reduces risk. Although there are increasing numbers of women with congenital heart disease who are considering pregnancy, as a result of joint expert specialist cardiac and obstetric care, maternal mortality is low. Most of the observed mortality occurs in women with structurally normal hearts who were not known to have heart disease before their pregnancy. It is therefore important that those caring for pregnant women are aware of the risk factors for and presentation of cardiac conditions in pregnancy. We review the presentation and management of both congenital and acquired heart diseases in pregnancy."

3,"Radiation-induced heart disease: a review of classification, mechanism and prevention.","With the increasing incidence of thoracic tumors, radiation therapy (RT) has become an important component of comprehensive treatment. RT improves survival in many cancers, but it involves some inevitable complications. Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is one of the most serious complications. RIHD comprises a spectrum of heart disease including cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease and conduction system abnormalities. There are numerous clinical manifestations of RIHD, such as chest pain, palpitation, and dyspnea, even without obvious symptoms. Based on previous studies, the pathogenesis of RIHD is related to the production and effects of various cytokines caused by endothelial injury, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress (OS). Therefore, it is of great importance for clinicians to identify the mechanism and propose interventions for the prevention of RIHD."
4,Acquired heart disease in low-income and middle-income countries.,"The burden of illness associated with acquired cardiac disease in children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) is significant and may be equivalent to that of congenital heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease, endomyocardial fibrosis, cardiomyopathy (including HIV cardiomyopathy) and tuberculosis are the most important causes. All are associated with poverty with the neediest children having the least access to care. The associated mortality and morbidity is high. There is an urgent need to improve cardiac care in LMIC, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia where the burden is highest."
5,Hypertension Is a Risk Factor for Several Types of Heart Disease: Review of Prospective Studies.,"Many prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that hypertension is a strong risk factor for total mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Heart disease includes coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, sudden cardiac death (SCD), sick sinus syndrome (SSS), cardiomyopathy, and aortic aneurysms. Most of the epidemiologic prospective studies of heart disease focused on coronary/ischemic heart disease. Here we comprehensively reviewed the association between hypertension and the above-mentioned heart diseases. We found that CHD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, aortic valvular disease, SCD, SSS, left ventricular hypertrophy, and abdominal aortic aneurysms were all associated with hypertension. Those relations tended to be stronger in men. The prevention of hypertension and lowering one's blood pressure may help reduce the risk of developing heart disease."
6,"Women and heart disease, the underrecognized burden: sex differences, biases, and unmet clinical and research challenges.","For many years the significance of heart disease in women was vastly underappreciated, and women were significantly underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical research. We now know that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for women. Women and men share many similarities in the pathophysiology and manifestations of heart disease. However, as research advances with the continued inclusion of more women, knowledge about gender differences between the female and male heart, both on a physiological and pathophysiological basis, grows. These differences can be found in all domains of cardiovascular health and disease, including heart rhythm, heart failure, coronary disease and valvular disease. Further understanding of gender differences in the heart is crucial for advancing our ability to maintain a healthy population and identify and treat heart disease in both women and men. Specific examples within the spectrum of heart disease will be discussed in this review paper, and areas for further research will be proposed."
7,Exercise training in patients with heart disease: review of beneficial effects and clinical recommendations.,"Over the last decades exercise training has evolved into an established evidence-based therapeutic strategy with prognostic benefits in many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs): In stable coronary artery disease (CAD) exercise training attenuates disease progression by beneficially influencing CVD risk factors (i.e., hyperlipidemia, hypertension) and coronary endothelial function. In heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) training prevents the progressive loss of exercise capacity by antagonizing peripheral skeletal muscle wasting and by promoting left ventricular reverse remodeling with reduction in cardiomegaly and improvement of ejection fraction. Novel areas for exercise training interventions include HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), pulmonary hypertension, and valvular heart disease. In HFpEF, randomized studies indicate a lusitropic effect of training on left ventricular diastolic function associated with symptomatic improvement of exercise capacity. In pulmonary hypertension, reductions in pulmonary artery pressure were observed following endurance exercise training. Recently, innovative training methods such as high-intensity interval training, resistance training and others have been introduced. Although their prognostic value still needs to be determined, these approaches may achieve superior improvements in aerobic exercise capacity and gain in muscle mass, respectively. In this review, we give an overview of the prognostic and symptomatic benefits of exercise training in the most common cardiac disease entities. Additionally, key guideline recommendations for the initiation of training programs are summarized."
8,Diabetic heart disease.,"Diabetes mellitus is responsible for a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The best known complications arise from endothelial dysfunction, oxidation, inflammation, and vascular remodelling and contribute to atherogenesis. However, the effects on the heart also relate to concurrent hypertensive heart disease, as well as direct effects of diabetes on the myocardium. Diabetic heart disease, defined as myocardial disease in patients with diabetes that cannot be ascribed to hypertension, coronary artery disease, or other known cardiac disease, is reviewed."
9,Scleroderma heart disease.,"Heart disease is a frequent and often severe feature of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Cardiomyopathy, with ventricular diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias, is the most important form, since it is associated with a very poor prognosis. The current challenge is to define its pattern and identify individuals at risk, but evaluation in vivo may be hard to perform. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the clinical aspects of scleroderma heart disease and the early pivotal role that coronary microcirculation dysfunction plays in its development. A discussion of the diagnostic tools now available for this frequently asymptomatic condition will be provided. Treatment options will be reviewed, even though no cure for systemic sclerosis exists, and the current therapy of diastolic dysfunction remains unsatisfactory."
