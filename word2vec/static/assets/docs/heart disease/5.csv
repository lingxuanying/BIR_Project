1,[Pediatric cardiology and congenital heart disease: from fetus to adult].,"This article contains a review of some of the most important publications on congenital heart disease and pediatric cardiology that appeared in 2010 and up until September 2011. Of particular interest were studies on demographic changes reported in this patient population and on the need to manage the patients' transition from the pediatric to the adult cardiology department. This transition has given rise to the appearance of new areas of interest: for example, pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease, and the effect of genetic factors on the etiology and transmission of particular anomalies. In addition, this review considers some publications on fetal cardiology from the perspective of early diagnosis and, if possible, treatment. There follows a discussion on new contributions to Eisenmenger's syndrome and arrhythmias, as well as on imaging techniques, interventional catheterization and heart transplantation. Finally, there is an overview of the new version of clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with congenital heart disease and of recently published guidelines on pregnancy in women with heart disease, both produced by the European Society of Cardiology."
2,Interventional treatment of structural heart disease.,"Transcatheter therapy of structural heart disease is advancing rapidly. Due to the less invasive approach, transcatheter techniques have replaced surgery as standard procedure for atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale closure. Evolving interventional techniques allow treatment of paravalvular leaks, ventricular septal defects and valve replacement. Until recently, therapy for these diseases was limited to patients in whom severe comorbidities lead to contraindications to surgery. Techniques to treat heart failure caused by left ventricular aneurysms or to prevent cardioembolic stroke by percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation are emerging. This article reviews current indications and recent developments in interventional treatment of structural heart disease."
3,Heart disease: from living to living well.,"Aysha Mendes, Editor, British Journal of Cardiac Nursing, aysha.freelance@gmail.com, discusses support for patients living with heart disease."
4,Heart disease in patients with stroke. Part II: Impact and implications for rehabilitation.,"Cardiac disease reduces the long-term survival of stroke patients and increases the likelihood of intercurrent medical illness during the rehabilitation phase. It remains controversial whether heart disease negatively affects functional capabilities after stroke, but most studies agree that associated cardiac disease, especially congestive heart failure, adversely affects functional outcomes after stroke rehabilitation. Reliable clinical assessment of the presence and severity of heart disease in stroke patients may be hampered by mobility limitations, communication deficits, and other problems. Therefore, specialized diagnostic methods may be needed. The development and application of effective and consistent medical and rehabilitation guidelines for proper comprehensive care may enhance the likelihood of achieving favorable outcomes and of avoiding complications in patients with stroke."
5,Overview of Equine Cardiac Disease.,"Equine heart diseases can be categorized with morphologic, etiologic, and physiologic diagnoses and classified anatomically as diseases of the pericardium, myocardium, valves (endocardium), and great vessels. An appreciation of normal and pathologic physiology is a key to understanding diagnosis and therapy of heart disease. Pathophysiologic diagnoses include arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Heart rhythm disturbances can occur in isolation or with structural disease. Heart failure stems from arterial filling owing to insufficient cardiac output. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with strenuous exercise, left heart failure, bronchopulmonary diseases, and pulmonary arteriopathies. The etiopathogenesis of these disorders are incompletely understood."
6,"Radiation induced heart disease: Pathogenesis, management and review literature.","Radiation therapy (RT) is a very important part of multimodality cancer therapy. Addition of RT improves survival in many cancers, but there are some accompaniments of radiation. One of them is radiation induced heart disease (RIHD). RT for mediastinal lymphoma, breast, lung and oesophageal cancer is associated with the development of RIHD. The problem can be intensified with the addition of chemotherapy. Therapeutic modalities for RIHD are the same as in the non-irradiated population. However, surgery may be difficult in the irradiated patients. The long latent period is the reason why RIHD is not extensively studied. Survival of cancer patients has improved over past few decades, so RIHD is a growing concern especially in younger patients. In this review article, we have discussed the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and management of RIHD along with impact of chemotherapeutic agents."
7,The constellation of hypertensive heart disease.,"Hypertension should be regarded not as a simple elevation of blood pressure, but as a constellation of functional and structural abnormalities that create a phenotypic portrait of hypertensive disease. Recent research has expanded our knowledge related to hypertensive heart disease. Future assessment of hypertensive patients' global risk should probably incorporate not only evaluation of the known traditional risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, smoking, glucose levels and left ventricular hypertrophy, but also myocardial fibrosis, microvascular ischaemia, arterial stiffness, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and level of apoptosis."
8,Frailty and heart disease.,"Frailty is emerging as a syndrome of pre-disability that can identify persons at risk for negative outcomes. Its presence places the individual at risk for rapid deterioration when a major event such as myocardial infarction or hospitalization occurs. In patients with cardiovascular disease, frailty is about three times more prevalent than among elderly persons without. Screening for frailty in heart disease is important not only because of its prognostic value, but also because a variety of therapeutic interventions are available."
9,"[Progress in pediatric cardiology, congenital heart disease in adults, and heart surgery for congenital heart disease].","The field of pediatric cardiology is continually developing and now covers not only congenital and acquired heart disease in children but also congenital heart disease in adults and the prenatal diagnosis and prevention of heart disease. This review highlights new findings in the field of genetics, selected articles on the use of magnetic resonance imaging and multislice CT in diagnosis, and recent publications on electrophysiology and the surgical treatment of children and adults with congenital heart disease. In addition, the increasingly advanced use of mechanical assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation in children is also discussed."
