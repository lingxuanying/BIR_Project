2,"Intracardiac thrombi: frequency, location, etiology, and complications: a morphologic review--Part IV.","Intracardiac thrombus may develop as a consequence of multiple underlying cardiac disorders. Valvular heart disease, in particular, rheumatic mitral stenosis is frequently associated with intracardiac thrombus. Part IV of this 5-part article on intracardiac thrombus focuses on the frequency and consequences of thrombus in valvular heart disease."

7,Cerebral ischemic attacks as a complication of heart disease: the value of echocardiography.,"The association of heart disease and cerebral ischemic attacks, and the usefulness of echocardiography in detecting heart disease and possible embolic source, were studied in 194 patients with transitory cerebral ischemic attack or stroke. The study revealed 95 patients with heart disease, and 63 of them had positive echocardiographic findings. All together, 35 patients had heart disease as a probable source for systemic embolism. An undetected cardiac disorder, not found by clinical examination or electrocardiography, was detected in 25 patients. The cardiac disorder found by echocardiography only, was most frequently aortic and mitral valve disease. Thus, echocardiography is an useful tool in detecting heart disease in these patients."
8,Cardiology. Exercise: a review.,"There is now little doubt that a lifestyle lacking in exercise can contribute to the development of heart disease. There have been many local and national initiatives to promote exercise and its relation to health and well-being, many linked to the targets set out in The Health of the Nation (DoH 1992)."
