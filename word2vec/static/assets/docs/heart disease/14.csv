2,Recognition and management of cardiovascular disease related to thyroid dysfunction.,"Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are both associated with clinically significant cardiovascular derangements. In hypothyroidism, these include pericardial effusion, heart failure, and the complex interrelationship between hypothyroidism and ischemic heart disease. Cardiovascular disorders associated with hyperthyroidism include atrial tachyarrhythmias, mitral valve dysfunction, and heart failure. Although these usually occur in individuals with intrinsic heart disease, thyroid dysfunction alone rarely causes serious but reversible cardiovascular dysfunction. Patients with commonly encountered cardiac disorders, e.g., idiopathic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, should be screened for potentially contributing subclinical thyroid diseases. In patients with heart failure and hypothyroidism, initial management should focus on diagnosis and optimal management of any primary cardiac disease, whereas in hyperthyroidism, aggressive measures to control excess thyroid hormone action should generally have the highest priority."
3,Cardiac late potentials for diagnosis in heart disease.,"In recent years abundant information has been obtained about the relationship of heart disease and cardiac late potentials. Non-invasive recordings of ventricular late potentials are useful in risk stratification of various clinical conditions, in particular, in patients following myocardial infarction. Here a close correlation has been established between cardiac late potentials and spontaneous or induced sustained ventricular tachycardias using programmed electrical stimulation. Cardiac late potentials also appear to be associated with arrhythmic events in patients with cardiomyopathies, and following unsuccessful antitachycardia surgery. Furthermore, recording of abnormal late potentials are associated both with acute rejection after cardiac transplantation and unsuccessful thrombolytic therapy after myocardial infarction. Interestingly, antiarrhythmic drugs have no clear effect on cardiac late potentials."
