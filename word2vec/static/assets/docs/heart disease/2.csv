3,Pulmonary Hypertension in Left Heart Disease.,"Pulmonary hypertension is common in left heart disease and is related most commonly to passive back transmission of elevated left atrial pressures. Some patients, however, may develop pulmonary vascular remodeling superimposed on their left-sided heart disease. This review provides a contemporary appraisal of existing criteria to diagnose a precapillary component to pulmonary hypertension in left heart disease as well as discusses etiologies, management issues, and future directions."
4,Regionalization of congenital heart disease care: A pending goal.,"Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are considered the most frequent malformations. In Mexico, every year between 12 and 16 thousand children are born with some type of CHD and it is the second cause of mortality in children under 1 year of age and in children aged between 1 and 4 years. The problem of the care of CHDs is analyzed from a perspective of health policies in the country with an emphasis on regionalizing their care to rationalize the use of available resources and with the aim of serving the largest number of patients and achieve the best clinical results. It emphasizes the need to promote cooperation among the different civil society organizations and institutions to exchange ideas to create consensus and joint projects for a better use of available resources to achieve universal and quality care of children with CHD in all the country."
5,Liver disease related to the heart.,"In this article, we review both acute and chronic liver diseases that occur as a result of heart or circulatory system failure. Ischemic hepatitis, congestive hepatopathy, cardiac cirrhosis, and Fontan liver disease are reviewed. We review clinical presentation, diagnostic data, prognosis, and available therapeutic strategies for these entities. We aim to increase awareness about cardio-hepatic disease as the prevalence of this disorder in adults is increasing. Due to advances in medical and surgical care, patients with heart disease are living longer and thus exposing long-term effects on the liver that are clinically relevant. There may be a role for dual organ transplantation in some cases, but this is a very challenging endeavor, and newer ideas about treatment or prevention are needed."
6,Biomarkers in pediatric heart disease.,"A biomarker is a characteristic that can be used as an indicator of a biological state. A biomarker can be a clinical observation, laboratory test or an imaging parameter. In this review, we discuss the use of biomarkers in differentiating cardiac from noncardiac disease; predicting the prognosis of patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy; diagnosing subclinical cardiac involvement in muscular dystrophy and postchemotherapy cancer patients; detecting acute rejection following heart transplantation; diagnosing Kawasaki disease; aiding the management of postoperative cardiac patients; and managing both common (tetralogy of Fallot) and complex (single-ventricle physiology) congenital heart diseases."
7,Heart disease in children.,"Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and medical and surgical management of neonates with cardiovascular disease has led to their improved survival rates. These improvements have resulted in an increased number of pediatric patients presenting to the primary care physician's office with underlying heart disease. Understanding the genetic, congenital, or acquired etiologies to the various pediatric heart diseases is crucial to preventing these lesions and treating these patients."
8,"Heart disease in cattle: diagnosis, therapeutic approaches and prognosis.","Heart disease in cattle remains medically challenging both to diagnose and to treat. This is in part due to its low incidence in the bovine species but also because the prognosis is typically guarded to poor. The majority of published data concerning bovine heart disease are case studies and case reports. The aim of this article is to review the evidence-based medicine on the principal heart diseases of cattle (pericarditis, bacterial endocarditis, congenital heart defects, cor pulmonale, dilated cardiomyopathy and heart neoplasms), with emphasis on their diagnosis, prognosis and treatment."
9,Biomarkers in congenital heart disease.,"The population of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) now exceeds the population of children with CHD. The long-term management of these patients relies on sequential assessment of anatomy and physiology and integration with symptoms, all targeted toward decision making around intervention. The advances in technology have vastly improved our assessment of anatomy and function. However, while the assessment of chronic heart failure in acquired heart disease has been revolutionized by the proven utility of cardiac biomarkers, their use in adult CHD is still being assessed."
