4,Hypertension and heart disease.,"Peripheral blood pressure and heart disease are closely linked. Hypertension is not only associated with, but also a cause of, heart disease and evidence is mounting that treating hypertension reduces cardiac events. The knowledge and management of blood pressure is a key element of cardiac care."
5,[Contra-indications to sports activities in cardiac patients].,"The cardiologist is faced with the problem of eliminating a subject with heart disease from a sports competition and of prescribing beneficial physical activity to patients with heart disease. The difficulty in the prescription (or contra-indication) is due to the need for an individual assessment of each case. Several general rules can be proposed for cases of heart disease with a high risk of mortality or with a poor haemodynamic status. In most cases, the beneficial or detrimental effect can not be predicted. In this review, the authors present various approaches, based on data from the literature, for different types of heart disease and for different sports. They conclude that each case requires a thorough investigation in order to reduce the number of victims of the sports stadium."
