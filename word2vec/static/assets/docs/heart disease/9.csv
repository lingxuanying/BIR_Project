1,[Physical and psychological characteristics of the community-dwelling elderly with heart disease].,"Objectives Although the survival rates of patients with heart diseases, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure, have increased, the incidence of heart disease in elderly individuals has also increased. We compared characteristics of the community-dwelling elderly with heart diseases (heart disease group) and without heart diseases (non-heart disease group).Methods A total of 758 elderly individuals participated in our survey (""Otassha-kensin"") in 2014. The heart disease group (47 men, 28 women) and the non-heart disease group (263 men, 420 women) were selected from among these participants. Data on comorbidities, medications, the Kihon check list (KCL), and social background (lifestyle, exercise habits, certification for using long-term care insurance, and Japan Science and Technology Agency Index of Competence [JST-IC]) were obtained through interview. Body composition, grip strength, 5 walking time (usual pace, maximum speed), timed-up and go test (TUG), single-leg standing time, cognitive function, and depression were evaluated to assess physical and psychological function. Frailty was defined by the KCL. For between-groups comparisons, the Student t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used. To determine factors related to heart disease with functional decline, we used a multiple logistic regression analysis with the group (the non-heart disease group [0] and the heart disease group [1]) as the dependent variable and the decline in physical and psychological function as the independent variable.Results Men in the heart disease group had less grip strength, worse balance, and lower JST-IC scores than did men in the non-heart disease group. Women in the heart disease group had greater 5 walking times (usual pace, maximum speed) than those in the non-heart disease group. Both men and women in the heart disease group overall used more drugs and statins, and medications for heart disease than did participants in the non-heart disease group. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, 5 walking time (maximum speed) was shown to be associated with heart disease.Conclusions The community-dwelling elderly with heart disease showed declined physical functions. Our results suggested that these functional declines may be induced via medication and/or declines in daily activity."
2,[Congenital heart diseases in women].,"Are there gender differences in prevalence, surgical results and long-term survival of patients with congenital heart disease? Available literature data allow us to state what follows. At birth there is a mild but significant prevalence of congenital heart disease in females. The most severe congenital heart diseases are less frequent in girls, but when they are present in females, they are linked to a higher surgical mortality rate, due perhaps to lower weight at birth and to the prevalence of extracardiac malformations and/or of associated genetic syndromes. On the other hand, in adults, surgery for congenital heart disease is at higher risk in males, and so the long-term survival rate is higher in females. Particular psychological attitudes, a higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension, as well as specific problems linked to the reproductive function characterize congenital heart disease in adult women. The knowledge and analysis of these data are essential for a correct management of congenital heart disease in neonates, children and adults."
3,Equine Cardiovascular Therapeutics.,"Heart disease can be defined as any abnormality of the heart whether it is a cardiac dysrhythmia or structural heart disease, either congenital or acquired. Heart failure occurs when a cardiac abnormality results in the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Heart disease can be present without leading to heart failure. Heart failure, however, is a consequence of heart disease. There are 4 main areas where the clinician can intervene to improve cardiac output with heart failure: preload, afterload, myocardial contractility, and heart rate."

6,HEART DISEASE IN OLD AGE.,"In a post-mortem analysis of 1,500 patients, aged 70 years or more, heart disease and malignancy were the two major causes of death. Coronary disease was exceedingly prevalent, almost one in five being subject to this form of heart disease, and 13% dying from its effects. The levelling of the sex ratio in coronary disease in the aged was a striking feature. The clinical manifestations of coronary thrombosis were often atypical. The incidence of demonstrable coronary thrombosis was as high as in younger age groups. The pathological findings and the incidence of local complications in coronary disease were similar to those in other age groups. Other causes of heart failure were relatively infrequent. Certain features of these conditions in old age are discussed. Cardiac amyloidosis, in the form associated with senility, occurred in a very few cases but did not contribute to heart failure."
7,The evolving role of genetics in the diagnosis and management of heart disease.,"The role of genetics in heart disease diagnosis and management is expanding daily. Clear genetic components have been found for diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Rhythm disturbances with genetic components are atrial fibrillation and long QT syndrome. Gene therapies to treat cardiac diseases include those designed to prevent vein graft stenosis and those that promote coronary angiogenesis."
8,Apoptosis in congenital heart disease.,"Morphogenesis in the human body is mediated to an important, but not exclusive, extent by apoptosis. That this is true in the heart is illustrated by primary pulmonary hypertension, which includes medial degeneration in both coronary and pulmonary arteries, normal and abnormal postnatal involution of the right ventricle, familial progressive heart block ending in fatal arrhythmias, and the long QT syndrome. Apoptosis occurs in ventricular myocardium, specialized myocytes of the conduction system, endothelium and medial smooth muscle of small arteries, cardiac nerves and ganglia and fibroblasts. The normal onset, duration and termination of apoptosis act beneficially. If apoptosis fails to occur or is too long continued, the result is harmful. Little is known of the signals controlling apoptosis in the human heart. Future research into these questions may radically change many of our present concepts of congenital heart disease."
9,[Heart disease and pregnancy: grounds for confidence in the safe outcome].,"Indications for prolongation of pregnancy and spontaneous delivery in women with congenital and acquired heart disease are proposed based on original observations and literature data. Special attention is given to risk factors of an undesirable outcome of pregnancy for mothers with high functional class cardiac insufficiency, high blood pressure gradient, and severe pulmonary hypertension with mitral valve and aortic stenosis."
