0,[Diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease].,"Scientific studies confirm correlation between periodontitis and systemic diseases such as: arteriosclerosis, diabetes, heart diseases, stroke, diseases of the respiratory system, kidney diseases, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, premature birth and low birth weight. The interaction between periodontitis and diabetes mellitus is described, based on the literature."
1,[Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus].,"Beside the clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus based on the measurement of blood glucose level, these days, the etiologic classification of the disease comes to the forefront. Genetic analysis (HLA typing, searching for glucokinase gene and mitochondrial gene mutations), immunologic examination (determination of islet specific autoantibodies) and measurement of the insulin secretory capacity help the etiologic classification. The most important result of classification is the discovery of the slowly progressive form of type 1 diabetes mellitus (formerly latent autoimmune diabetes in adults). Another direction of diagnostic procedures is the prediction of the disease in nondiabetic population. The prediction of type 1 diabetes is not specific enough at present, but that of type 2 diabetes can be done easily."
2,Complications of type 1 diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide and the concern regarding the number of new cases of diabetes relates to the development of chronic complications. It has been recognized for years that the complications are a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide and as such, negatively affect the quality of life in individuals with diabetes with an increase in disability and death. Specifically, the complications of diabetes have been classified as either microvascular (ie, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) or macrovascular (ie, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and peripheral vascular disease). For purposes of this article, the authors focus on a brief review of the major complications."
3,Diabetes mellitus and cystic fibrosis.,"There is a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with CF and this is likely to increase in the future as more patients are surviving into adult life. In view of this all CF clinics should routinely screen for diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in adult CF patients is higher than in children, and the onset is commonly insidious. The diabetes seen in CF is not classical Type 1 diabetes or Type 2 diabetes and could more helpfully be called cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). Treatment is by oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin. It is not appropriate to control patients by diet alone. Dietary advice to CF diabetic patients is not the same as that given to non-CF diabetic patients. Microvascular complications have now been reported and careful monitoring of all CF patients with diabetes should be undertaken."

5,Coming full circle in diabetes mellitus: from complications to initiation.,"Glycaemic control, reduction of blood pressure using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system and control of dyslipidaemia are the major strategies used in the clinical management of patients with diabetes mellitus. Each of these approaches interrupts a number of pathological pathways, which directly contributes to the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, including renal disease, blindness, neuropathy and cardiovascular disease. However, research published over the past few years has indicated that many of the pathological pathways important in the development of the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus are equally relevant to the initiation of diabetes mellitus itself. These pathways include insulin signalling, generation of cellular energy, post-translational modifications and redox imbalances. This Review will examine how the development of diabetes mellitus has come full circle from initiation to complications and suggests that the development of diabetes mellitus and the progression to chronic complications both require the same mechanistic triggers."
6,Diabetes mellitus secondary to chronic pancreatitis.,"From the present review it appears that insulin-dependent diabetes is a common finding in chronic pancreatitis, and impaired secretion of insulin from beta-cells of the pancreatic islets is essential for the development of this form of secondary diabetes. Judged from a positive correlation between insulin secretory capacity and stimulated pancreatic enzyme output, beta-cell function may decrease in parallel with exocrine pancreatic function. However, in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis beta-cell function was preserved to a greater extent and glucoregulation was better than in comparable Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. Immunological phenomena and associations with certain HLA-alleles characterizing Type 1 diabetes mellitus were not found in insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. This may contribute to the slower destruction of the beta-cells in chronic pancreatitis than encountered in Type 1 diabetes. The small number of chronic pancreatitis patients who developed totally absence of endogenous insulin production still have some alpha-cell function during i.v. arginine and meal stimulation. However, insulin-induced hypoglycemia and insulin withdrawal did not stimulate glucagon secretion in the secondary diabetic patients in contrast to comparable Type 1 diabetics. Nevertheless, blood glucose counterregulation is intact in the secondary diabetics due to preserved catecholamine secretion. Furthermore, ketonemia develops during dissipation of insulin, in spite of absence of increased glucagon secretion, emphasizing the role of insulin dissipation for the development of ketoacidosis in this form of diabetes. The suggested increased susceptibility to severe hypoglycemia and less tendency to development of ketonemia may further be influenced by altered insulin sensitivity, nutritional factors and concomitant hepatic failure in diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic polypeptide secretion was absent in chronic pancreatitis without endogenous insulin production. Pancreatic polypeptide secreting cells thus seem to be at least as vulnerable as the beta-cells to the destructive processes characterizing chronic pancreatitis, whereas glucagon secreting alpha-cells preserve secretory capacity to a greater extent than PP-cells and beta-cells. No data, however, favour the view that absent pancreatic polypeptide secretion has any major effect on the glucoregulation in diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Increased plasma concentration of somatostatin was found in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. The source of somatostatin in the patients is unknown, but somatostatin may contribute to a reduction in overall blood glucose level in patients without endogenous insulin secretion due to inhibition of glucagon secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
7,Management of diabetes mellitus in clinical practice.,"Diabetes is a global health problem, with a challenging epidemiology. It is one of the major health problems affecting countries around the world, particularly the UK (World Health Organization [WHO], 2006; Department of Health [DH], 2006b). It is also a growing public health threat in the US (Mokdad et al, 2001). As a result, diabetes has become an important public health issue, prompting the WHO and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) to adopt the theme 'Diabetes for Everyone' for World Diabetes Day 2006. In 2007, on World Diabetes Day, the United Nations also launched its 'Living with Diabetes at School' campaign, in response to the growing diabetes 'epidemics' (Diabetes UK, 2007). This article provides an overview of diabetes mellitus and its acute- and long-term management, including definition, aetiology, pathophysiology, classification, signs, symptoms and complications. The role of the nurse in providing patient-centred care for people with diabetes is emphasized."
