0,Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus: new criteria.,"New recommendations for the classification and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus include the preferred use of the terms ""type 1"" and ""type 2"" instead of ""IDDM"" and ""NIDDM"" to designate the two major types of diabetes mellitus; simplification of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus to two abnormal fasting plasma determinations; and a lower cutoff for fasting plasma glucose (126 mg per dL [7 mmol per L] or higher) to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. These changes provide an easier and more reliable means of diagnosing persons at risk of complications from hyperglycemia. Currently, only one half of the people who have diabetes mellitus have been diagnosed. Screening for diabetes mellitus should begin at 45 years of age and should be repeated every three years in persons without risk factors, and should begin earlier and be repeated more often in those with risk factors. Risk factors include obesity, first-degree relatives with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia or previous evidence of impaired glucose homeostasis. Earlier detection of diabetes mellitus may lead to tighter control of blood glucose levels and a reduction in the severity of complications associated with this disease."
1,Diabetes mellitus and its complications in India.,"India is one of the epicentres of the global diabetes mellitus pandemic. Rapid socioeconomic development and demographic changes, along with increased susceptibility for Indian individuals, have led to the explosive increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in India over the past four decades. Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indian people is characterized by a young age of onset and occurrence at low levels of BMI. Available data also suggest that the susceptibility of Asian Indian people to the complications of diabetes mellitus differs from that of white populations. Management of this disease in India faces multiple challenges, such as low levels of awareness, paucity of trained medical and paramedical staff and unaffordability of medications and services. Novel interventions using readily available resources and technology promise to revolutionise the care of patients with diabetes mellitus in India. As many of these challenges are common to most developing countries of the world, the lessons learnt from India's experience with diabetes mellitus are likely to be of immense global relevance. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology of diabetes mellitus and its complications in India and outline the advances made in the country to ensure adequate care. We make specific references to novel, cost-effective interventions, which might be of relevance to other low-income and middle-income countries of the world."
2,Pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.,"As we learn more about the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus, we find that there is more yet to be learned. This may sound like a trite statement, but in reality it is true. The following article reviews the basic pathophysiology of both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus as we understand it today. It continues on to reveal the ""things that go wrong"" when there is too much or too little glucose available to the body organs and especially to the brain. The article points out the signs and symptoms to be aware of when the person is in the acute state of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (or state), and severe hypoglycemia. It concludes with important considerations when the individual is in one of these acute states and contributes key points related to the control of diabetes when the person is in the state of compromise."

8,Diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus occurs commonly in the older patient and is frequently undiagnosed. In many cases, the initial manifestations of diabetes mellitus are lower extremity complications with which this disease is known to be associated. Unfortunately, these complications are similar to other age-related degenerative processes; therefore, vigilance for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is essential in the evaluation and treatment of lower extremity pathologic conditions."
9,[Diabetes mellitus].,"The globalization became the topic the most often discussed in the socio-economic field by the media. The direct and indirect effects on the chronic diseases are not fully explored, especially by the biomedicine. Through the filter of the complex thought, which connects instead of disjoining, we try to widen the debate around the diabetes which became an emblematic disease. This change of perspective should enable us to approach the chronic diseases differently. It is the objective of this review."
