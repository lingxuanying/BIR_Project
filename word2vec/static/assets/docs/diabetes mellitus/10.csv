4,[Classification of diabetes: an increasing heterogeneity].,"Diabetes mellitus is usually subdivided into type 1 and type 2. Despite precise criteria, distinction between these two types of diabetes can be difficult because of cases with superposition of the two classes. Adults aged 20 to 40 are particularly at risk of presenting an intermediary type of diabetes and thus are subject to misclassification. The distinction between these subtypes is relevant because of the therapeutic decision and the outcome which relies on insulin supply and therefore the evolution to insulin dependence. Thus, it seems important to review a new and more accurate classification of diabetes to offer a more appropriated care to patients."

7,Cognition and diabetes: a lifespan perspective.,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive dysfunction and abnormalities that can be seen with brain imaging. Recent studies provide important new insights into the nature and severity of these cerebral complications that help to explain why some patients with diabetes have clinically relevant neurocognitive morbidity, whereas most are apparently unaffected. This Personal View investigates the hypothesis that clinically relevant diabetes-related cognitive decrements mainly occur at two crucial periods in life: when the brain is developing in childhood, and when the brain undergoes neurodegenerative changes associated with ageing. Outside of these periods cognitive decrements mainly occur in patients with notable diabetes-related comorbidities, in particular microvascular or macrovascular complications. The identification of crucial periods and conditions for the development of diabetes-related cognitive decrements helps to draw the attention of physicians to individuals at risk and can direct future studies into the mechanisms that underlie these conditions."
8,"Diabetes-science, serendipity and common sense.","This paper is dedicated to young researchers in diabetes. One such person was Frederick Banting who, with his colleagues, isolated insulin in 1921, saving the lives of literally millions of people. What factors allowed Banting and other scientists to produce work that has immensely benefited the human race? I propose that it is the combination of good scientific background (the 'prepared mind'), commonly some serendipity taken with a good dose of common sense and supplemented by enthusiasm, tenacity and good mentoring, which drives the 'power of observation' and the ability to take forward the good idea. I give examples from history to support this and then discuss some of the 'truths, perspectives and controversies' within the diabetes arena when I first started in diabetes research in the late 1970s. I describe how my appetite was initially 'whetted' for research by moving to an excellent clinical research environment with encouragement to test ideas and controversies initially in a clinical research programme, followed by more scientific/basic research. The work that I performed as a young doctor and research fellow led to a lifelong professional interest in three major areas-causes and interventions for diabetes vascular disease, studies of the molecular genetics of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and work on diabetes in different ethnic groups. I provide a summation of my own and other people's work to demonstrate how research can be progressed and lead to patient benefit as well as providing an incredibly rewarding career. I believe that we need to encourage and put more resources into development of young doctors and scientists wishing to undertake research in our discipline. Areas ripe for much-needed clinical research programmes, for example, include work on best practice/provision of health care, application of the evidence base from clinical trials to achieve public health gains, attention to adherence issues and better-tolerated therapies. Most importantly, a greater emphasis on prevention through public health measures and 'buy in' from the whole population is urgently required."
9,[Diabetes mellitus: current classification based on cause and sharpened blood glucose limits for diagnosis].,"Recently new definitions were agreed for the glucose tolerance test (GTT), for impaired glucose tolerance and for the classification of diabetes mellitus. The World Health Organization and the American Diabetes Association have been active on this point. The fasting glucose value has been lowered and been brought into line with the two hour value of the GTT. Fasting glucose values can now be used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and of impaired glucose tolerance. The new classification is based on differences in cause of the diabetes. The classification includes diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2, pregnancy diabetes and 'other forms of diabetes'."
