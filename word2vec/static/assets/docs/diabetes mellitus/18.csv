2,Does psychological stress cause diabetes?,"Many patients believe that their diabetes has been caused by stress or an adverse life event. Whereas there is strong evidence that psychological stress is related to a deterioration in glycaemic control in established diabetes, there is much less evidence that psychological stress can cause diabetes in humans de novo. It seems more likely that psychological stress produces a deterioration in glycaemia in the non-symptomatic patient which in turn makes diabetic symptoms and the diagnosis evident. The pathogenic mechanisms which have been suggested to relate psychological stress to diabetes are described and reviewed."
3,Lessons learned from young-onset diabetes in China.,"The prevalence of young-onset diabetes is rapidly rising in China. Young-onset diabetes is etiologically and phenotypically heterogeneous. Thirty percent to 50% of these patients have insulin secretory failure owing to autoimmune or monogenic or other yet to be identified forms of diabetes. Others have a strong family history of diabetes and exhibit features of the metabolic syndrome. Management of these young patients poses major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, which require a multidisciplinary and holistic approach to ensure that these subjects are identified early and managed appropriately. Understanding the molecular basis of diabetes in these subjects may also eventually lead to improvement in diagnosis, classification, and treatment."

5,Speculations on etiology of diabetes mellitus. Tumbler hypothesis.,"Although clinically useful, the conventional partition of diabetes mellitus into two major classes, insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent, has become obsolete from an etiological standpoint. Contemporary research, particularly that with advanced cellular and molecular methodologies, suggests that the expression of diabetes depends on a wide range of factors. We suggest that the etiology of diabetes has become analogous to the cylinder of a lock containing many tumblers. Each tumbler, e.g., environment, genetics, or cellular interactions, must be aligned before the key can be turned and an understanding of the etiologic process claimed."

7,Methodological issues in diabetes research. Measuring adherence.,"The prevalence of nonadherence in IDDM and NIDDM populations and conceptual and methodological issues relevant to measuring diabetes regimen adherence are reviewed. The prevalence of nonadherence varies across the different components of the diabetes regimen, during the course of the disease, and across the patient's life span. Although prevalence rates might be expected to differ between IDDM and NIDDM populations, this rarely has been evaluated. Conceptual problems in defining and measuring adherence include: the absence of explicit adherence standards against which the patient's behavior can be compared; inadvertent noncompliance attributable to patient-provider miscommunication and patient knowledge/skill deficits; the behavioral complexity of the diabetes regimen; and the confounding of compliance with diabetes control. Methods for measuring adherence include: health status indicators, provider ratings, behavioral observations, permanent products, and patient self-reports, including behavior ratings, diaries, and 24-h recall interviews. A measurement method should be selected on the basis of reliability, validity, nonreactivity, sensitivity to the complexity of diabetes regimen behaviors, and measurement independence from the patient's health status. The timing of measurements should be based on the stability of adherence behaviors and temporal congruity with other measures of interest (e.g., indexes of metabolic control). Directions for future research and suggestions for clinical practice are provided."
8,Welcome to Diabetes.,
9,Obesity and type-2 diabetes in the elderly.,"Type-2 diabetes is common in the elderly and when compounded by obesity presents a major challenge for the physician. Obesity plays a central role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes. Body weight is determined by an interaction between genetic, environmental and psychosocial factors acting through the physiological mediators of energy intake and expenditure. Obesity is thought to predispose to type-2 diabetes primarily by causing insulin resistance. Education and changes in lifestyle remain the key issues in obesity management. Anti-obesity drugs may delay the onset of diabetes but there is limited experience of their use in elderly patients. Obesity should not be viewed as a cosmetic problem that affects a few individuals, but a major health hazard that is both preventable and amenable to treatment."
