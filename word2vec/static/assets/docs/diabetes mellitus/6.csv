0,Preparing nurses to face the pandemic of diabetes mellitus: a literature review.,"Background: Diabetes constitutes a global public health problem. Today about 135 million people are affected and it is estimated that the number in 2025 will be 300 million. Aims: By reviewing existing literature the aim is to raise awareness among nurses, nurse educators and nursing students of the global epidemic of diabetes mellitus, its multiple underlying causes, especially social ones, and how to fight it. A further aim is to discuss the implications for future curriculum content in nurse education programmes. Findings: The main underlying causes of the disease are genetic and environmental factors, such as urbanization and industrialization, as well as increased longevity and changes in lifestyle from a traditional healthy and active life to a modern, sedentary, stressful life and over-consumption of energy-dense foods. This process, labelled 'coca-colonization', is evident all over the world, although more so in developing countries. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus varies among populations due to differences in genetic susceptibility and social risk factors such as change in diet, obesity, physical inactivity and, possibly, factors relating to intrauterine development. Migrants are especially affected. Diabetes mellitus needs to be treated by a holistic approach through dietary adjustment, exercise, medication (if needed), education and self-care measures. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease. The main implication for nurses and nursing curricula is to change the focus from the individual with diabetes mellitus and management to prevent deterioration of health (secondary prevention), to population-based community-intervention programmes. These need to focus on health promoting activities to raise awareness among healthy people of the risk factors for diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Nurses all over the world have an important role in fighting the diabetic pandemic by health promotion aimed to keep people healthy as long as possible."
1,Etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.,"The concept that diabetes mellitus is not a single disease. but rather a clinical syndrome characterized by inappropriately elevated fasting or post-prandial blood glucoses and the development of long-term microvascular, macrovascular, and neuropathic changes is of very recent origin and stems from numerous investigations into the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, and pathogenesis of clinical diabetic states. This article reviews some of these data and indicates that the various forms of diabetes mellitus have markedly different etiologies and pathogenetic mechanisms and that these must be recognized in order to understand and care for patients."
2,Diabetes in Africans. Part 2: Ketosis-prone atypical diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes is increasing with ageing and changes in lifestyle in populations of African ancestry as described in the first part of this review. Apart from classical type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, atypical presentations are observed in these populations, especially ""tropical"" and ""ketosis-prone"" atypical diabetes. Ketosis-prone atypical diabetes that has been classified by ADA as idiopathic Type 1 diabetes or Type 1b is the most common atypical form. It is characterised by an acute initial presentation with severe hyperglycaemia and ketosis, as classical Type 1 diabetes. In the subsequent clinical course after initiation of insulin therapy, prolonged remission is often possible with cessation of insulin therapy and maintenance of appropriate metabolic control. Metabolic studies showed a markedly blunted insulin secretory response to glucose, partially reversible with the improvement of blood glucose control. Variable levels of insulin resistance are observed, especially in obese patients. Pancreatic B-cell autoimmunity is an exceptional finding. Association with type 1 susceptibility HLA alleles is variable. The molecular mechanisms underlining the insulin secretory dysfunction are still to be understood and may involve gluco-lipotoxicity processes, glucagon dysregulation, effect of stress, or may be genetically determined. The present review summarises the available clinical and metabolic features and suggests some pathogenetic hypotheses and principles of management for the ketosis-prone atypical diabetes of the Africans."
3,Role of endothelin-1 in diabetes mellitus.,Endothelin-1 is mainly synthesized by the vascular endothelial cells and acts on the vascular smooth muscle. Because of its vasoconstrictor and mitogenic effects it plays a role in the development of vascular diseases. In diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis is accelerated. The authors summarize the available data of the role of endothelin-1 in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus and the development of diabetic complication.

6,Paediatric diabetes.,"Diabetes does not spare any section of society, and its prevalence in the paediatric and adolescent age group is rising. This review highlights the etiological and clinical features of childhood diabetes, including secular changes in epidemiology. It discusses the aspects of non pharmacological and pharmacological therapy which are unique to the paediatric age group, and explores current use of novel therapeutic modalities. The article calls for modulation of the psychological environment of the child with diabetes, to help improve his or her quality of life, and sensitizes physicians to take proactive, affirmative action to address the special needs of children with type1 diabetes."

9,[Disease management for diabetes mellitus to prevent the onset and progression of complications].,"We developed a new critical pathway technique and an outbound-inbound call center system. The former is to support general physicians to care for outpatients with diabetes mellitus according to practice guidelines. We employed the ""Overlay method"" to develop personalized optimal critical pathways. Our overview critical pathways consist of basic sheets for regular examinations and optional sheets on which the kinds and frequencies of medical examinations are determined according to many parameters, such as methods of treatment, the severity of diabetic complications, and knowledge levels. The critical pathway is continually modified according to the change in the patient's condition. The latter is to maintain and enhance the treatment motivation of outpatients. Call center agents collect medical information, making outgoing calls using a questionnaire about the patient's health status and diabetic complications as well as receiving incoming calls. When patients do not visit on the appointment date, call center agents arrange the next consultation to prevent treatment dropout. These systems are now under evaluation in a clinical trial of outpatients with diabetes mellitus."
