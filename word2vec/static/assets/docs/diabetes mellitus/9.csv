1,Personalized medicine in diabetes.,"Background: Multiple genes that are associated with the risk of developing diabetes or the risk of diabetes complications have been identified by candidate gene analysis and genomewide scanning. These molecular markers, together with clinical data and findings from proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenetics, and other methods, lead to a consideration of the extent to which personalized approaches can be applied to the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Content: Known genes that cause monogenic subtypes of diabetes are reviewed, and several examples are discussed in which the genotype of an individual with diabetes can direct considerations of preferred choices for glycemic therapy. The extent of characterization of polygenic determinants of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is summarized, and the potential for using this information in personalized management of glycemia and complications in diabetes is discussed. The application and current limitations of proteomic and metabolomic methods in elucidating diabetes heterogeneity is reviewed. Summary: There is established heterogeneity in the determinants of diabetes and the risk of diabetes complications. Understanding the basis of this heterogeneity provides an opportunity for personalizing prevention and treatment strategies according to individual patient clinical and molecular characteristics. There is evidence-based support for benefits from a personalized approach to diabetes care in patients with certain monogenic forms of diabetes. It is anticipated that strategies for individualized treatment decisions in the more common forms of diabetes will emerge with expanding knowledge of polygenic factors and other molecular determinants of disease."
2,"[Diabetes mellitus--definition, classification and diagnosis].","Diabetes mellitus comprises of a group of heterogeneous disorders which have an increase in blood glucose concentrations in common. The current classifications for diabetes mellitus type 1-4 are described and the main features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are compared to allow for better discrimination between these diabetes types. Furthermore, the criteria for the correct biochemical diagnosis during fasting and during oral glucose tolerance tests are summarized. These data form the basis of the recommendations of the Austrian Diabetes Association for the clinical practice in diabetes."
3,[Diabetes mellitus: facts and hypotheses].,"The paper summarizes the experience gained in examining diabetes mellitus and its complications in the experimental and clinical settings for many years. It forwards the basic aspects in the major problems of diabetology: etiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and therapy. The paper analyses the fate of some hypotheses advanced in different years and emphasizes new advances made in theory and practice of medicine."

8,Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus in old age in Japan.,"Epidemiological studies on diabetes mellitus revealed that the number of patients with diabetes mellitus is gradually increasing in Japan along with development of car society and westernization of food intake. Since prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases with aging, proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus aged over 60 has exceeded two-third of estimated total number of patients (7.40 million in 2002) in Japan where aging of society is rapidly progressing. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is common in diabetes mellitus in old age, and there are rarely elderly patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Prevalence of both diabetic microangiopathy and atherosclerotic vascular diseases is higher in the elderly with diabetes mellitus than in the middle-aged with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, atherosclerotic vascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, cerebro-vascular disease and peripheral vascular disease) are more prevalent in the elderly with diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes mellitus. Many studies demonstrated that functional declines, i.e. decreases in activities of daily living, physical activity and cognitive function, deteriorated quality of life in the elderly, and functional declines are more prominent in the elderly with diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes mellitus. In order to clarify how the elderly patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated to maintain their quality of life, a nationwide randomized controlled intervention study using 1173 Japanese elderly patients with diabetes mellitus is now performing. In summary, number of elderly patients with diabetes mellitus is overwhelmingly increasing in Japan as well as in westernized countries. It is necessary for us to treat the elderly with diabetes mellitus to maintain their function and quality of life."
