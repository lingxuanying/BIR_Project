2,[Therapy of diabetes mellitus today].,"The therapy of diabetes mellitus is always connected with the observation of an adapted diet, the aim of which is the obtaining of the optimal weight. Still more intensive concentric educational measures for patients and persons endangered by diabetes are necessary, in which cases muscular action is of increasing importance. Sulfonylureas furthering the secretion of insulin are to be used only as far as necessary. Peripherally acting anti-diabetics, such as biguanides have an indication in diabetes mellitus which is exactly defined and to be observed. Also with regard to the combat against adiposity their influence on the lipometabolism needs further clarification. Metabolic and immunologic insulin resistance are complications of the insulin therapy. The extensive technical preparation of the human synthetic insulin may contribute to the improvement of the prognosis of diabetes. At present the introduction of artifical beta-cell-systems is a problem of the diminishing of the apparatuses. The genetic consultation for diabetics is important and in many cases possible."
3,Survey on etiological diagnosis of diabetes in 1244 Italian diabetic children and adolescents: impact of access to genetic testing.,"Type 2 and monogenic diabetes are emerging causes of diabetes in youths. Among 1244 Italian patients <18 years of age, 91.9% had type 1, 0.2% type 2, and 4.9% monogenic diabetes. Monogenic diabetes ranks second as a cause of diabetes in Italian youth, while type 2 diabetes appears to be rare."
4,Aretaeus of Cappadocia and the first description of diabetes.,"The name Aretaeus of Cappadocia has been linked with diabetes more than that of any other physician of antiquity, his texts forming a sophisticated synthesis of the previous knowledge on this disease copiously supplemented by his own observations. Gifted with a unique faculty for observing pathologic phenomena, he was able to elaborate upon earlier texts enriching them with his own original findings and numerous thoughtful reflections. Among the many diseases he dealt with, Aretaeus has bequeathed to us an outstandingly vivid and accurate description of diabetes."

6,Cultural and religious influences in diabetes care in Great Britain.,"Type 2 diabetes is four times more common in people originating from the Indian subcontinent (Asians) than in white English Caucasians. British Asians with diabetes have been shown to have poorer blood glucose control, awareness of diabetes management, and knowledge of complications. This review examines some of the dietary customs that can affect glucose control, problems with communication and diabetic education, and a brief description of health beliefs commonly held by Asian patients that may help the physician understand why some patients appear to show poor compliance with accepted Western medicine. Patients must always be approached as individuals with their own unique needs within the context of their cultural backgrounds."
7,[New diagnostic and classification system in diabetic syndrome].,"Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder. Evidence for heterogeneity is based on measuring endogenous insulin level since some forty years ago. Insulin is lacking at the time of diagnosis in most patients, whose disease started rapidly, with classical symptoms, and who are mainly children, adolescents or young adults. In the majority of middle-aged, obese diabetics, insulin levels are frequently high at diagnosis. Since insulin measuring from sera became a routine laboratory test these two main types were nominated as insulin-dependent, and insulin non-dependent types (IDDM and NIDDM). The aim of the recent classification was, that different diabetic subgroups should be based on etiologic evidence. (Previous classification was based mainly due to the current therapy!). To avoid confusing nominations, the recent classification recommended to abandon the acronyms, IDDM and NIDDM, and only type-1 and type-2 should be used In the third subgroup-other diabetic groups--there are selected many disorders, whose etiology is mostly clear. As fourth subgroup gestational diabetes preserved its previous place. There are some differential-diagnostic problems in between type-1 and type-2 subgroups, especially between lean body weight type-2 and-the newly discovered latent-onset diabetes in adults (LADA). Diagnostic criteria of diabetes and prediabetic states are being changed according to epidemiological data, because type-2 patients die frequently from cardio-cerebrovascular fatal disorders, and elevated blood sugar values-especially postprandially-contribute to it. Thresholds of blood sugar values for diagnosing diabetes are therefore decreasing, and a new category: impaired fasting glucose (IFG, blood sugar: 6, 1-7.0 mmol/l) was introduced. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) remained as prediabetic state. IGT + IFG are nominated as impaired glucoregulation. These two categories cover different populations. Oral glucose loading test in most problematic cases should be carried out. The clinical importance of postprandial hyperglycaemia (postprandial state) is discussed. As a new clinical concept, the Metabolic Syndrome seems to replace type-2 diabetes in the majority of these patients, even in the impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) state. Diabetics, carrying the features of this syndrome need holistic care."
8,Medications or lifestyle change with medical nutrition therapy.,"The United States is experiencing epidemics of both diabetes and obesity. Lifestyle intervention, including medical nutrition therapy (MNT), has been demonstrated to be clinically effective for the prevention and treatment of diabetes; however, it is often underutilized. The majority of people with diabetes are cared for by primary care providers. They should be providing persons with diabetes initial basic nutrition messages that are accurate and can be easily understood; referring to a registered dietitian; following up on the person's progress with nutrition intervention; and providing continued education and support. MNT, along with physical activity, should be the initial monotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, upon the initial diagnosis and given the blood glucose level is less than 200 mg/dL. The success of MNT is usually seen within 6 weeks and up to a maximum of 6 months. This is the point at which the person with diabetes and their provider(s) should decide whether MNT alone is succeeding or whether medication is needed."
