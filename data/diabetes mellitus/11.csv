6,"[Is diabetes mellitus, diagnosed between the ages of 30-45, a special sub-type?].","Diabetes diagnosed in the so-called middle age of life is debated from the typological point of view. The authors investigated 45 diabetics, whose disease had been diagnosed between the age of 30-45 years. As a result of their observations they state that diabetes in this age range is heterogenous. Patients can be classified into insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent types of diabetes. Two of their patients could be classified into a newly described subtype (early onset diabetes, EOD). For the time being it seems that the exact delineation of this new diabetic subtype needs more detailed observations."

8,"Not quite type 1 or type 2, what now? Review of monogenic, mitochondrial, and syndromic diabetes.","Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous group of conditions defined by resultant chronic hyperglycemia. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and the increasing understanding of genetic etiologies, we present a broad review of rare genetic forms of diabetes that have differing diagnostic and/or treatment implications from type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Advances in understanding the genotype-phenotype associations in these rare forms of diabetes offer clinically available examples of evolving precision medicine where defining the correct genetic etiology can radically alter treatment approaches. In this review, we focus on forms of monogenic diabetes, mitochondrial diabetes, and syndromic diabetes."
