0,"[Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus: prevalence, incidence, pathogenesis, and prognosis].","According to the WHO definition the term diabetes mellitus covers a group of metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. The two main representatives of this group are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All forms of diabetes have in common that, due to hyperglycemia, complications (vascular damage in particular) can occur, which are responsible for the high rate of morbidity as well as the excess mortality of the group of persons affected. In all populations--Germany included--the overwhelming majority of diabetics are subjects with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is almost 20 times more common than type 1 diabetes, i.e. almost 90% of all diabetic persons can be assigned to the type 2 diabetes category. The rest can be split up into 5-7% type 1 diabetics and 2%-5% of persons suffering from secondary forms of diabetes (pancreatic and hepatic diseases). Positive antibody tests in older diabetic persons suggest that type 2 diabetes may not be a uniform disease and that in almost 10% of cases an autoimmune disease might be the cause of diabetes in old age (LA-DA diabetes). The data of the diabetes register of the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) together with representative samples obtained from the federal states that comprised West Germany indicate a diabetes prevalence of about 5% in the adult population of Germany. Once the new WHO diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus are used and an early-diagnosis procedure (the oral glucose tolerance test) is widely applied the prevalence is expected to be shown to be higher. What is more, the global trend toward higher figures for type 1 and type 2 diabetes can also be observed in Germany. Whereas the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of beta cells, leading to insulin deficiency, in type 2 diabetes insulin resistance as well as impaired insulin secretion are present; mechanisms that interact closely in the development of glucose intolerance. Strong genetic and environmental factors operate with regard to both types. The reduction of the life expectancies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes is contingent upon the appearance of micro- and/or macrovascular complications. At the top of the mortality statistics are patients suffering from cardiovascular and/or kidney diseases. However, by applying metabolic control and by means of other intervention strategies the prognoses for diabetic patients can be improved significantly."

7,New-onset diabetes after renal transplantation.,"Transplantation medicine has grown to be an important element of medical practice, and with the development of modern immunosuppression agents and protocols, the occurrence of diabetes as renal transplantation is recognized as one of the metabolic consequences of therapy with these agents. New-onset diabetes after transplantation can be defined as diabetes mellitus developing in any patient without history of diabetes before transplantation, who has sustained hyperglycemia that meets the current diagnostic criteria by the American Diabetes Association or by the World Health Organization. New-onset diabetes after transplantation has been associated with the following risk factors: age, non-white ethnicity, hepatitis C infection, glucocorticoid therapy for rejection, and chronic immunosuppression with cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The observation that current immunosuppression using tacrolimus is one of the most important single risk factor for the development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation has been made. The pathophysiology of this condition resembles that of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is conclusive evidence that pretransplantation end-stage renal disease is an insulin-resistant state, and after transplantation, glucocorticoids induce further peripheral insulin insensitivity. The ""second hit"" seems to be an acquired (yet reversible) insulin secretion defect caused by the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine but more pronounced with tacrolimus. Future directions include pretransplantation and posttransplantation testing using glucose measurements and other techniques to identify high-risk individuals and possibly develop treatment strategies aimed to modify insulin resistance as well as to preserve beta cell function."
