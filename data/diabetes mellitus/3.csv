2,Mechanisms of diabetic complications.,"It is increasingly apparent that not only is a cure for the current worldwide diabetes epidemic required, but also for its major complications, affecting both small and large blood vessels. These complications occur in the majority of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Among the most prevalent microvascular complications are kidney disease, blindness, and amputations, with current therapies only slowing disease progression. Impaired kidney function, exhibited as a reduced glomerular filtration rate, is also a major risk factor for macrovascular complications, such as heart attacks and strokes. There have been a large number of new therapies tested in clinical trials for diabetic complications, with, in general, rather disappointing results. Indeed, it remains to be fully defined as to which pathways in diabetic complications are essentially protective rather than pathological, in terms of their effects on the underlying disease process. Furthermore, seemingly independent pathways are also showing significant interactions with each other to exacerbate pathology. Interestingly, some of these pathways may not only play key roles in complications but also in the development of diabetes per se. This review aims to comprehensively discuss the well validated, as well as putative mechanisms involved in the development of diabetic complications. In addition, new fields of research, which warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets of the future, will be highlighted."

4,Sex differences in diabetes and kidney disease: mechanisms and consequences.,"Type 1 and type 2 diabetes, along with their accompanying hyperglycemia, are associated with a multitude of comorbidities including the development of diabetic kidney disease. Although the hallmarks of these metabolic disorders have been well characterized in population and animal studies, it is becoming increasingly apparent that diabetes manifests itself differently in men and women. This review summarizes the recent diabetic literature with a focus on known sex differences in clinical and preclinical studies. It explores the physiological differences of glucose handling and the development of diabetes between men and women. This review also uncovers potential mechanisms for these differences, honing in on the vital role that sex hormone signaling plays in the progression of diabetes and renal complications."

8,Precision medicine in diabetes.,"This review presents the dynamic and fast growing concept of precision medicine in a simple and succinct manner. It describes the potential of precision medicine in diabetes praxis, under three headings: diagnosis of type of diabetes, choice of pharmacotherapy for glucose lowering, and management of complications of diabetes. This review should make the scope of precision medicine easy to understand for the practicing physician."
