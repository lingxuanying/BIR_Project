0,Cost drivers in diabetes care: the problems they present and potential solutions.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that affects many aspects of the lives of diagnosed patients and their families, the health care industry, and society. The majority of the economic literature on diabetes addresses the cost of treating diabetes but not the outcomes of clinical interventions. The primary cost of treating diabetes is related to short-term care to achieve euglycemia and long-term care associated with complication of the disease. The short-term costs of achieving euglycemia can be overshadowed by the decreased risk of long-term complications. The difficulty of providing care for a chronic disease such as diabetes arises from the high short-term costs of clinical interventions, the positive benefits of which may not be realized for many years. The results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial show a correlation between the intensive treatment of diabetes and a decreased risk of the development of long-term complications. Whether intensive treatment is practical, effective, and cost-effective in a real-world setting is a topic for further study. In the meantime, health care providers with a good knowledge of the clinical and economic elements of available therapeutic options can develop individualized care regimens for their patients with diabetes that are high quality and cost-effective."

5,Acute and chronic animal models for the evaluation of anti-diabetic agents.,"Diabetes mellitus is a potentially morbid condition with high prevalence worldwide thus being a major medical concern. Experimental induction of diabetes mellitus in animal models is essential for the advancement of our knowledge and understanding of the various aspects of its pathogenesis and ultimately finding new therapies and cure. Experimental diabetes mellitus is generally induced in laboratory animals by several methods that include: chemical, surgical and genetic (immunological) manipulations. Most of the experiments in diabetes are carried out in rodents, although some studies are still performed in larger animals. The present review highlights the various methods of inducing diabetes in experimental animals in order to test the newer drugs for their anti-diabetic potential."
6,"Acquired non-type 1 diabetes in childhood: subtypes, diagnosis, and management.","Over the past 30 years it has become apparent that not all diabetes presenting in childhood is autoimmune type 1. Increasingly type 2 diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young, iatrogenic diabetes, and rare syndromic forms of diabetes such as Wolfram's syndrome have been identified in children. This review is aimed at the general paediatrician looking after children with diabetes, and aims to provide an algorithm for assessment, investigation, and suggested management for the newly diagnosed child with suspected non-type 1 diabetes. This article will also be relevant to the child with atypical diabetes-that is, on low insulin doses outside the honeymoon period."
7,Controversies in diabetes in 2013 - a brief update.,"Incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate. Therefore, a proper understanding of the mechanisms and efficient treatment of the disease is becoming increasingly important. The article briefly describes controversies in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) pathogenesis and diagnosis (genetic background, accelerator hypothesis, new autoantibodies, new information on LADA - latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, and the role of TRAIL - tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and treatment (how to deal with fluctuations of blood glucose concentrations and the occurrence of hypoglycemia, the role of healthy lifestyle, especially physical exercise, and a proper diet, treatment of insulin resistance and the challenges in detecting diabetic neuropathy). Moreover, issues in the pathogenesis of macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are considered (novel risk factors - vascular hyperglycemic memory, hypoglycemia, altered profile of microRNAs expression, impaired function of vascular progenitor cells, altered fibrin clot properties and iron-induced blood coagulation). Modern treatment of T2DM, based on lifestyle intervention and antidiabetic drugs, is full of controversies and it seems that over time the number of uncertainties is constantly increasing. Recent trials have reported disappointing results in lifestyle intervention (LOOK-AHEAD) and antihyperglycemic treatment (ACCORD, SAVOR-TIMI 53, EXAMINE, concerns about sulfonylureas safety). Moreover, there are considerable deviations from treatment targets that are recommended by the guidelines (blood glucose, hypertension, blood lipids) in real-life clinical practice in patients at different stages of the disease development. It seems that beneficial modification of the natural history of diabetes is unlikely in the foreseeable future unless we are able to obtain a more in-depth understanding of the pathomechanisms of the disease."
8,[Sugar diabetes. Update elements].,"The various types of diabetes mellitus are now more precisely classified according to their etiopathogenies. Therefore, type 1 (autoimmune or not), type 2, gestational diabetes, as well as MODY (Maturity Onset-Diabetes of the Young) and secondary diabetes are considered as separate entities. Any type of diabetes brings its set of complications. Biological chemistry is directed to define the etiopathogenic characteristics of the various types of diabetes and to assess the severity of metabolic and functional disturbances. Diagnostic criteria in term of glycemia have also been reviewed to asses diabetes and glucose intolerance."
9,Exercise therapy in Japan.,"The purpose of this report is to outline the exercise therapy of diabetes mellitus that has been administered in Japan during the past 10 years, with special emphasis on the results of studies on metabolic effects as well as on practical aspects of exercise therapy. The studies on the response to exercise clarified neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism in exercise and provided a basis for the indication of exercise therapy in view of the pre-existing metabolic abnormalities. Concerning the training effects, changes of insulin sensitivity have been chiefly studied in relation to metabolic improvement by physical training using the insulin clamp method. The improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism obtained during the training program, consisting of fast walking or jogging corresponding to 40-60% of predictive VO2 max for 30-60 min daily, was suggested to be related to improved insulin sensitivity in patients with NIDDM. Intensive studies have been made on exercise programs, and medical checks and guidelines for exercise prescription have been provided. Aerobic exercises with stretching and low-level callisthenics are recommended, and the usefulness of a multi-stage exercise loading test and the necessity of self-monitoring of blood glucose are stressed for the successful management of exercise therapy."
