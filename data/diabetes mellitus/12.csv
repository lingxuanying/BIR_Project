1,[Diabetes mellitus: from clinical knowledge to public health concern].,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease whose prevalence is increasing worldwide. It remains associated with a high risk of severe complications, essentially micro- and macro-vascular complications. Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease that leads to the destruction of insulin-secreting B cells and therefore requires an intensive optimised exogenous insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disease whose expression is favoured by inadequate lifestyle, leading to obesity. It combines a relative insulin secretory defect and insulin resistance, the latter being associated with various other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment consists of lifestyle modifications first, then the prescription of various glucose-lowering oral drugs and finally, when requested, insulin therapy. A multi-risk intervention is mandatory to improve the cardiovascular prognosis. The prevention of diabetes and its complications is a major public health objective."

Children and Adolescents: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2018.,"The American Diabetes Association (ADA) ""Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes"" includes ADA's current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA's clinical practice recommendations, please refer to the Standards of Care Introduction Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC."
8,[Secondary diabetes].,"Secondary diabetes can be defined as a diabetic condition that develops after the destruction of the beta-cells in the pancreatic islets and/or the induction of insulin resistance by an acquired disease (e.g. endocrinopathies) or others. Recently, diabetes mellitus has divided into four distinct types (type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, other specific types of diabetes and gestational diabetes) in the Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus in USA. The categories between secondary diabetes and the other specific types of diabetes might be different a little, some of the latter being described here. The details of the genetic defects in insulin action has been presented elsewhere (see Chapter V-3)."
9,Diagnosis and approach to posttransplant diabetes.,"The availability of new immunosuppressive drugs has led to improvement in outcome for transplanted patients, but these drugs have also led to the increase of metabolic abnormalities, such as dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, which can affect graft and patient outcome. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) or new-onset diabetes after transplantation is defined as the onset of diabetes in previously nondiabetic transplant recipients. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the involvement of PTDM in death due to infectious and cardiovascular disease. This article reviews recent concepts on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PTDM."
