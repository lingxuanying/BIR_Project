1,Infectious disorders drug targets,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence supporting a central role of the viral-induced hyper-inflammatory immune response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is an emerging prognostic marker in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum procalcitonin and clinical severity and outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated in patients with COVID-19 infection from February to April 2020 at Hajar Hospital in the Shahrekord University of Medical Science, Shahrekord, Iran. RESULTS: The results showed that total lymphocyte counts, albumin, calcium, and creatinine levels were significant different between the two moderate and severe groups, and the mean of procalcitonin level in COVID-19 patients with severe disease was higher (0.36 ng/mL) compared with the patients with moderate disease, and its level was found to be >5 ng/mL in 14.2% of5 ng/mL in 14.2% of patients in the former group. CONCLUSIONS: PCT may be a marker of disease severity in COVID-19 and may contribute to determine the severity of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, serial PCT measurements may be beneficial in predicting the prognosis."

STUDY DESIGN: Suspected COVID-19 pediatric cases that were tested in a Portuguese hospital between March 17 and April 2 2020 were included in this descriptive retrospective study. The analyzed data included socio-demographic parameters, characteristics of the household, underlying medical conditions and symptoms. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were included and all of them were symptomatic and treated without hospitalization. The most common symptoms were cough (80%;n=75), rhinorrhea (72%;n=68) and fever (60%;n=56). There was only one positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a five-year-old child with mild illness without epidemiologic linkage. CONCLUSION: This study showed a low rate of confirmed COVID-19 in children. The causes for this low rate can be multifactorial and illustrates how differently this virus spreads in the pediatric population."
4,Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,"Management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has emerged as a challenge during the COVID-19 era. There has been a significant increase in the morbidity and mortality associated with ACS both as a direct and an indirect consequence of the pandemic. In this review, we provide an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on patients presenting with ACS and current practices for managing patients presenting with chest pain during the pandemic and for ensuring safety of healthcare professionals. We also discuss treatment strategies and post-ACS care along with current and future perspectives for management of ACS during future waves of COVID-19 infection or similar pandemics."
5,Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,"Much has changed in the 2 years since the start of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The need for social distancing catalyzed the digitization of healthcare delivery and medical education-from telemedicine and virtual conferences to online residency/fellowship interviews. Vaccine development, particularly in the field of mRNA technology, led to widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines. With improved survival from acute infection, the healthcare system is dealing with the ever-growing cohort of patients with lingering symptoms. In addition, social media platforms have fueled a plethora of misinformation campaigns that have adversely affected prevention and control measures. In this review, we examine how COVID-19 has reshaped the healthcare system, and gauge its potential effects on life after the pandemic."

7,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),"Thousands of drugs, nutraceuticals and their combinations can be used to select candidate therapeutics for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its symptoms in order to curb COVID-19. A comprehensive, multi-level strategy against COVID-19 should include drug targeting of biomolecules and biochemical pathways involved in the prevention and proliferation of the infection, and the fatal or serious symptoms following infection. Several drugs are routinely used in the treatment of different categories of seriously ill COVID-19 patients including tocilizumab, remdesivir and dexamethasone. The current risk/benefit assessment supports the emergency testing and approval of more drugs. The process for new drug selection could be based on the identification of one drug for one target, or of a multi-potent drug for many targets and drug combinations for one or more targets, that can cause a substantial reduction in the high mortality rate of COVID-19. Several drugs have been identified that can fit this potential role by targeting different stages of COVID-19 including baricitinib, molnupiravir and PF-07321332/ritonavir and also the combination of deferiprone with N-acetylcysteine for inhibiting the vicious circle of oxidative stress toxicity and endothelial cell damage. Most of these drugs are expected to be effective against all the SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron (B.1.1.529) and also the associated COVID-19 complications."

9,Current molecular medicine,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people globally, in this regard, known as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). There is sufficient scientific evidence that a preventive COVID-19 vaccine is the most effective approach to combat with COVID-19 pandemic, therefore there is an essential need for safe and protective vaccines to fight it. METHODS: Global efforts in developing a vaccine against COVID-19 have resulted in the development of different vaccine platforms with various safety and efficacy including live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid-based vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nucleic acid-based vaccines consist of mRNA and DNA vaccines have shown promising results in stimulating cellular and humoral immune responses properly against COVID-19, which their rapid and easy manufacturing process compared to others have made them considerable. mRNA-based vaccines platform by Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna companies are the first approved vaccines for emergency use against COVID-19. RESULTS: This narrative review highlights the recent advances in developing nucleic acid-based vaccines for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The fast global dissemination of the coronavirus has highlighted the urgent necessity to build an efficient vaccine to inhibit disease. Cooperative attempts throughout the world have paid to the fast and unprecedented production of vaccines. Much needs to be learned regarding SARSCoV-2 and vaccine development against it."
