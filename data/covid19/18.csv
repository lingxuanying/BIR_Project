0,BMJ open gastroenterology,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 and consequent pandemic has presented unique challenges. Beyond the direct COVID-related mortality in those with liver disease, we sought to determine the effect of lockdown on people with liver disease in Scotland. The effect of lockdown on those with alcohol-related disease is of interest; and whether there were associated implications for a change in alcohol intake and consequent presentations with decompensated disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to seven Scottish hospitals with a history of liver disease between 1 April and 30 April 2020 and compared across the same time in 2017, 2018 and 2019. We also repeated an intermediate assessment based on a single centre to examine for delayed effects between 1 April and 31 July 2020. RESULTS: We found that results and outcomes for patients admitted in 2020 were similar to those in previous years in terms of morbidity, mortality, and length of stay. In the Scotland-wide cohort: admission MELD (Model for End-stage Liver Disease) (16 (12-22) vs 15 (12-19); p=0.141), inpatient mortality ((10.9% vs 8.6%); p=0.499) and length of stay (8 days (4-15) vs 7 days (4-13); p=0.140). In the Edinburgh cohort: admission MELD (17 (12-23) vs 17 (13-21); p=0.805), inpatient mortality ((13.7% vs 10.1%; p=0.373) and length of stay (7 days (4-14) vs 7 days (3.5-14); p=0.525)). CONCLUSION: This assessment of immediate and medium-term lockdown impacts on those with chronic liver disease suggested a minimal effect on the presentation of decompensated liver disease to secondary care."
1,Talanta,"The current outbreaking of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic threatens global health and has caused serious concern. Currently there is no specific drug against SARS-CoV-2, therefore, a fast and accurate diagnosis method is an urgent need for the diagnosis, timely treatment and infection control of COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we developed a field effect transistor (FET) biosensor based on graphene oxide-graphene (GO/Gr) van der Waals heterostructure for selective and ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 proteins detection. The GO/Gr van der Waals heterostructure was in-situ formed in the microfluidic channel through pi-pi stacking. The developed biosensor is capable of SARS-CoV-2 proteins detection within 20 min in the large dynamic range from 10 fg/mL to 100 pg/mL with the limit of detection of as low as approximately 8 fg/mL, which shows approximately 3 x sensitivity enhancement compared with Gr-FET biosensor. The performance enhancement mechanism was studied based on the transistor-based biosensing theory and experimental results, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced SARS-CoV-2 capture antibody immobilization density due to the introduction of the GO layer on the graphene surface. The spiked SARS-CoV-2 protein samples in throat swab buffer solution were tested to confirm the practical application of the biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 proteins detection. The results indicated that the developed GO/Gr van der Waals heterostructure FET biosensor has strong selectivity and high sensitivity, providing a potential method for SARS-CoV-2 fast and accurate detection."
2,"Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS","In early 2019 in the UK, concern about the risk of COVID-19 transmission to surgeons who operate near to the airway led to wide scale adoption of different masks, including valved types used in industry. It was noted early on that although these masks protect clinicians, they may represent a risk to the patient due to unfiltered air being directed towards them during close contact(1) and the National Health Service circulated guidance to that effect(2). Subsequently, an increased incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) was noticed, postulated to be due to contamination of the surgical field by microbial particles from valved masks or hoods leading to a National Patient Safety Alert(3). A study recommended that a surgical mask be placed over the exhaust valves of these mask types(4). We reviewed the literature using the key words surgical masks, power hoods, FFP3 masks and surgical site infection. Most studies showed no reduction in the incidence of SSI with surgical masks(5), but some showed an increase(6). There were no studies comparing bacterial contamination of the surgical site with different types of masks. A pilot study was designed to evaluate if FFP3 respirators and powerhoods allowed bacterial contamination of the surgical field in comparison with standard surgical masks and no masks. The results appeared to confirm our methodology and suggested that reusable valved FFP3 masks are associated with bacterial dissemination. Subsequent examination of these masks identified a potential mechanism for this bacterial contamination. A larger scale study is needed."
3,European journal of pediatrics,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to fundamental changes in daily routines of children. Our aim was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of fractures among Israeli children during 2020 compared with 2015-2019. Demographic, clinical data, and incidence rates of fractures in individuals aged < 18 years were derived from the electronic database of Meuhedet Health Services, which provides healthcare services to 1.2 million people in Israel. We further subdivided the year to five periods according to government regulations of lockdown and isolation at each period. Fracture sites were determined according to ICD9 definitions. During 2020, 10,701 fractures occurred compared with 12,574 +/- 599 fractures per year during 2015-2019 (p-value < 0.001). Fracture rates were lower during all periods in 2020. The largest decline was observed during the first lockdown for both boys (56% decline, 95% confidence interval [CI] 52-60%) and girls (47% decline CI 41-53%). While the fracture rate declined for most age groups, the largest decline was recorded for the age group 11-14 years, with significant reduction rates of 66% (CI 59-71%) for boys and 65% (CI 54-73%) for girls. The most prominent declines were of fractures of the hand bones of both boys and girls (64% and 59%, respectively). Conclusions: Our data showed a significant decrease in fracture rate in 2020 compared to the previous 5 years, as well as differences between periods within that year. What is New: *The COVID-19 pandemic led to fundamental change in daily routines of children with significant decrease in school attendance and sport activities. *Consequent to these public health measures, the incidence rate of pediatric fractures decreased significantly. What is New: *This study demonstrates declines in fracture rates during lockdown periods, with only partial reversing of the trends between the lockdown periods. *The most pronounced decline was observed during the first lockdown period. *The decline was most prominent in children aged 11-14 years; there was no significant change in fracture incidence of children aged <3 years."
4,Andrology,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are critical factors of virus transmission. Expression of ACE 2 is highest in testes, and testicular function and testosterone levels were affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Low testosterone levels are related to infections, especially respiratory tract infections, and could worsen clinical conditions by exacerbating cytokine storms and increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the acute and chronic effects of COVID-19 on gonadal functions. Our second aim was to detect the relationship between free testosterone levels and disease prognosis and determine the impact of low-free testosterone on admission to ICU. METHODS: Eighty-one patients with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Twenty-nine patients were assessed again for six months post-COVID-19 follow-up, and 7 of them had semen analysis. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total testosterone levels were measured. RESULTS: In this observational study, 71.6% (n = 58) of patients had low free testosterone levels at baseline, in which 69% were considered as secondary hypogonadism. A longer length of hospitalization and increased inflammatory markers (d-dimer, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) were detected in the low-free testosterone group. FSH, total, free, and bioavailable testosterone levels were lower in patients who required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Free testosterone levels were inversely correlated with the length of hospitalization and prognostic disease factors. Oligozoospermia and impaired progressive motility were present in 42.8% (3/7) of the patients. In the six months post-COVID-19 follow-up, out of 29 patients, 48.2% still had low testosterone levels. CONCLUSION: A high rate of hypogonadism (71.6%) was found, especially secondary hypogonadism, and about half of the patients had hypogonadism in the 6th-months follow-up. Low free testosterone levels were correlated with inflammatory parameters, and it is related to ICU admission. Studies with long-term follow-up data in larger groups are needed to determine persistent hypogonadism and impaired spermatogenesis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
5,Environmental research,"Green spaces are associated with increased well-being and reduced risk of developing psychiatric disorders. In this study, we aimed to investigate how residential proximity to green spaces was associated with stress response buffering during the COVID-19 pandemic in a prospective cohort of young mothers. We collected information on stress in 766 mothers (mean age: 36.6 years) from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort at baseline of the study (from 2010 onwards), and during the COVID-19 pandemic (from December 2020 until May 2021). Self-reported stress responses due to the COVID-19 pandemic were the outcome measure. Green space was quantified in several radiuses around the residence based on high-resolution (1m(2)) data. Using ordinal logistic regression, we estimated the odds of better resistance to reported stress, while controlling for age, socio-economic status, stress related to care for children, urbanicity, and household change in income during the pandemic. In sensitivity analyses we corrected for pre-pandemic stress levels, BMI, physical activity, and changes in health-related habits during the pandemic. We found that for an inter-quartile range contrast in residential green space 300m and 500m around the residence, participants were respectively 24% (OR=1.24, 95%CI: 1.03 to 1.51) and 29% (OR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.04 to 1.60) more likely to be in a more resistant category, independent of the aforementioned factors. These results remained robust after additionally controlling for pre-pandemic stress levels, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, urbanicity, psychological disorders, and changes in health-related habits during the pandemic. This prospective study in young mothers highlights the importance of proximity to green spaces, especially during challenging times."
6,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the extent to which the network structure of anxiety and depression among adolescents identified during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic could be cross-validated in a sample of adolescents assessed after the COVID-19 peak. METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted between February 20 and 27, 2020 and between April 11 and 19, 2020, respectively. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using 20-item the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, respectively. Anxiety-depression networks of the first and second assessments were estimated separately using a sparse Graphical Gaussian Model combined with the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. A Network Comparison Test was conducted to assess differences between the two networks. RESULTS: The most central symptoms in the first and second survey networks were Depressed affect and Nervousness. Compared with connections in the first survey network, connections in the second survey network analysis between Relax- Nervousness-Depressive affect-Interpersonal problems (diff, contrast: second survey-first survey. diff=-0.04, P=0.04; diff=-0.03, P=0.03; diff=-0.03, P=0.04), and Irritability-Somatic complaints (diff=-0.04, P=0.02) were weaker while connections of Somatic complaints-Nervousness (diff=0.05, P<0.001), Somatic complaints-Depressive affect (diff=0.03, P=0.009), and Irritability-Control worry-Restlessness (diff=0.02, P=0.03; diff=0.05, P=0.02) were stronger. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed affect emerged as a robust central symptom and bridge symptom across Anxiety-Depression networks. Considering the negative impact of depression and anxiety on daily life, timely interventions targeting depressed affect should be implemented to reduce the co-occurrence of anxious and depressed symptoms among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic."
7,Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic required a change in outpatient care delivery models, including shifting from in-person to virtual visits, which may have impacted care of vulnerable patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe the changes in management, control, and outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated with the shift from in-person to virtual visits. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In veterans aged >/= 65 years with T2D, we assessed the rates of visits (in person, virtual), A1c measurements, antidiabetic deintensification/intensification, ER visits and hospitalizations (for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, other causes), and A1c level, in March 2020 and April-November 2020 (pandemic period). We used negative binomial regression to assess change over time (reference: pre-pandemic period, July 2018 to February 2020), by baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI; > 2 vs. <= 2) and A1c level. KEY RESULTS: Among 740,602 veterans (mean age 74.2 [SD 6.6] years), there were 55% (95% CI 52-58%) fewer in-person visits, 821% (95% CI 793-856%) more virtual visits, 6% (95% CI 1-11%) fewer A1c measurements, and 14% (95% CI 10-17%) more treatment intensification during the pandemic, relative to baseline. Patients with CCI > 2 had a 14% (95% CI 12-16%) smaller relative increase in virtual visits than those with CCI <= 2. We observed a seasonality of A1c level and treatment modification, but no association of either with the pandemic. After a decrease at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a rebound in other-cause (but not hypo- and hyperglycemia-related) ER visits and hospitalizations from June to November 2020. CONCLUSION: Despite a shift to virtual visits and a decrease in A1c measurement during the pandemic, we observed no association with A1c level or short-term T2D-related outcomes, providing some reassurance about the adequacy of virtual visits. Further studies should assess the longer-term effects of shifting to virtual visits in different populations to help individualize care, improve efficiency, and maintain appropriate care while reducing overuse."
8,Physiotherapy theory and practice,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of pain and disability among adults worldwide. For many individuals with knee OA, accessing proper physiotherapy services is difficult, especially with the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a telephone-based physiotherapy (PT) care program for people with knee OA. METHODS: This was a pilot feasibility study, with a cross-over design and repeated measures. Two groups with knee OA were recruited, an immediate therapy group (IG) and a delayed therapy group (DG). The therapeutic program involved a telephone call from a physiotherapist to the participants 3/week for 8 weeks. Physiotherapist delivered to participants educational information on knee OA, followed-up on adhering to daily therapeutic exercises and coached participants regarding exercises while using a behavioral-change framework to ensure proper therapy. Following the 8-weeks program, the IG group were advised to continue exercises and the DG group were provided with the same telephone-based PT program. RESULTS: Forty participants were enrolled in the study (IG = 20; DG = 20). There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. The results of our study showed that the telephone-based PT program led to improvements across all outcome measures. Participants reported that they had less pain, less stiffness, and an overall improvement in physical function. CONCLUSIONS: A telephone-based PT program appears to be feasible and effective in yielding significant benefits among individuals with knee OA."
9,Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,"Purpose: This study investigated the association between professional quality of life, working context, and mental health outcomes among hospital personnel in Taiwan during the worldwide upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Patients and Methods: We recruited 503 hospital personnel to whom we administered online questionnaires containing items from the Professional Quality of Life (ProQoL) scale, which covers compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout (BO) and compassion fatigue (CF), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and questions on work-related variables. Data were collected from 13 July to 19 August 2020. Results: The participants generally reported moderate CS and BO and low CF. Overall prevalence of mild-to-extremely-severe stress, anxiety and depression was 24.5%, 39.6% and 31.2%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression revealed that moderate-to-high BO and CF correlated with increased risks of mild-to-extremely-severe stress (OR = 4.17 and 2.23, respectively), anxiety (OR = 4.86 and 2.81, respectively) and depression (OR = 5.83 and 3.01, respectively), while moderate-to-high CS correlated with reduced risks of stress (OR = 0.53) and depression (OR = 0.45) only. There were CS and BO differences in groups categorized by marital status and profession. Anxiety increased linearly by seniority <10, 10-19 and >/=20 years (p for trend <0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, the subscales of ProQOL, BO and CF appeared to be associated with increased risks of stress, anxiety and depression among hospital personnel during the COVID-19 epidemic. A long-term contingency program may be needed to adjust work context variables and support emotional well-being of these workers."
