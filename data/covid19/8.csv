2,Environmental science and pollution research international,"This study examined the influence of tail risks on global financial markets, which aids in better understanding of the emergence of COVID-19. This study looks at the global and Vietnamese stock markets impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to identify systemic emergencies. Risk dependent value (CoVaR) and Delta link VaR are two important tail-related risk indicators used in Conditional Bivariate Dynamic Correlation (DCC) (CoVaR). The empirical findings demonstrate that when COVID-19's worldwide spread widens, the volatility transmission of systemic risks across the global stock market and multiple exchanges shifts and becomes more relevant over time. At the time of COVID-19, the world industrial market was larger than the Vietnamese stock market, and the Vietnamese stock market posed a lesser danger to the global market. A closer examination of the link between the Vietnam value-at-risk (VaR) range index sample and the world stock index indicates a significant degree of downside risk integration in key monetary systems, particularly during the COVID-19 era. Our study findings may help regulators, politicians, and portfolio risk managers in Vietnam and worldwide during the unique moment of uncertainty created by the COVID-19 epidemic."

4,AIDS and behavior,"People living with HIV (PLWH) are at greater risk for severe COVID-19 and are a priority population for COVID-19 vaccination. As of June 15, 2021, 61.6% of PLWH in Oregon received >/= 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Younger PLWH, Hispanic/Latinx PLWH and PLWH who inject drugs or reside in rural and frontier areas had low vaccine uptake while PLWH who were engaged in care, enrolled in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, and vaccinated against influenza had high vaccine uptake. Greater advocacy, education, and care navigation are required to increase COVID-19 vaccine access and uptake among PLWH."

6,JMIR formative research,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic spurred an increase of online information regarding disease spread and symptomatology. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to systematically assess the quality and readability of articles resulting from frequently Google-searched COVID-19 terms in the United States. METHODS: We utilized Google Trends to determine the 25 most commonly searched health-related phrases between 2/29/20 and 4/30/20. The first 30 search results for each term were collected, and articles were analyzed using Quality Evaluation Scoring Tool (QUEST). Three raters scored each article in authorship, attribution, conflict of interest, currency, complementarity, and tone. A readability analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Exactly 709 articles were screened, and 195 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The mean article score was 18.4 +/- 2.6 out of 28 with 7% scoring in the top quartile. National news outlets published the largest share (36%) of articles. Peer-reviewed journals attained the highest average QUEST score compared to national/regional news outlets, national/state government sites, and global health organizations (all p < 0.05). The average reading level was 11.7 +/- 1.9 (range 5.4 to 16.9). Only 3 (1.6%) articles were written at the recommended 6th grade levels. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 related articles are vastly varied in their attributes and levels of bias and would benefit from revisions for increased readability."
7,European journal of psychotraumatology,"Background: It has been suggested that resilience is best conceptualized as healthy and stable functioning in the face of a potentially traumatic event. However, most research on this field has focused on self-reported resilience, and other patterns of response when facing adversity, in cross-sectional designs. Objective: Alternatively, we aimed to study changing patterns of psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population, based on patterns of symptoms, and factors contributing to those patterns. Method: A national representative sample of Spain (N = 1,628) responded to an internet-based survey at two assessment points, separated by 1 month (April and May 2020), during the official national confinement stage. Based upon whether participants exhibited absence/presence of distress (i.e., significant trauma-related, depression, or anxiety symptoms) at one or two of the assessment times, patterns of psychological responses were defined by categorizing individuals into one of the four categories: Resilience, Delayed distress, Recovered, and Sustained distress. Results: Analyses of the levels of disturbance associated with the symptoms provided support to that four-fold distinction of patterns of responses. Furthermore, resilience responses were the most common psychological response to the pandemic. Multinomial regression analyses revealed that the main variables increasing the probability of resilience to COVID-19 were being male, older, having no history of mental health difficulties, higher levels of psychological well-being and high identification with all humanity. Also, having low scores in several variables (i.e., anxiety and economic threat due to COVID-19, substance use during the confinement, intolerance to uncertainty, death anxiety, loneliness, and suspiciousness) was a significant predictor of a resilient response to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with previous literature that conceptualizes resilience as a dynamic process. The clinical implications of significant predictors of the resilience and the rest of psychological patterns of response are discussed."
8,AIDS and behavior,"People with HIV (PWH) are at risk for adverse mental health outcomes, which could be elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study describes reasons for changes in mental health among PWH during the pandemic. Data come from closed- and open-ended questions about mental health changes from a follow-up to a cohort study on PWH in Florida during part of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020-March 2021). Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Among the total sample of 227 PWH (mean age 50.0, 49.7% men, 69.2% Black/African American, 14.1% Hispanic/Latino), 30.4% reported worsened mental health, 8.4% reported improved mental health, and 61.2% reported no change. The primary reasons for worsened mental health were concerns about COVID-19, social isolation, and anxiety/stress; reasons for improved mental health included increased focus on individual wellness. Nearly one-third of the sample experienced worsened mental health. These results provide support for increased mental health assessments in HIV treatment settings."
9,Perspectives in psychiatric care,"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the effects of workload on the styles of anger expression and ""trait anger"" of health professionals working in a COVID-19 pandemic hospital. DESIGN AND METHODS: This descriptive study was carried out at a COVID-19 pandemic hospital in Turkey. The sampling consisted of 493 healthcare professionals. The data were evaluated with the SPSS (23.0) software program. FINDINGS: The study found that the participants who perceived the workload as higher, and could not tolerate the work they performed, were high in ""trait anger"" levels and their anger was suppressed. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health institutions should consider the recognition of emotional risks and the planning of interventions as a priority for professionals involved in the care of COVID-19 infected patients."
