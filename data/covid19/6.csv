0,Molecular diversity,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China, is continuously spreading worldwide, creating a huge burden on public health and economy. Ayurveda, the oldest healing schema of Traditional Indian Medicinal (TIM) system, is considered as a promising CAM therapy to combat various diseases/ disorders. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of 3038 Ayurvedic herbs (AHs) against SARS-CoV-2, in this study, multi-targeting and synergistic actions of constituent 34,472 phytochemicals (APCs) are investigated using a comprehensive approach comprising of network pharmacology and molecular docking. Immunomodulatory prospects of antiviral drug-alike potentially effective phytochemicals (PEPs) are presented as a special case study, highlighting the importance of 6 AHs in eliciting the antiviral immunity. By evaluating binding affinity of 292 PEPs against 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we develop and analyze a high-confidence ""bi-regulatory network"" of 115 PEPs having ability to regulate protein targets in both virus and its host human system. Furthermore, mechanistic actions of PEPs against cardiovascular complications, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are also investigated to address the regulatory potential of AHs in dealing with COVID-19-associated metabolic comorbidities. The study further reports 12 PEPs as promising source of COVID-19 comorbidity regulators."
1,Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],"INTRODUCTION: Understanding the different transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in planning effective interventions in healthcare institutions. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of SARS-Cov-2 genome on inanimate surfaces in COVID-19 intensive care unit and emergency care cohorts. METHODS: This is a prospective cross-sectional study. Samples of the environmental surface of objects and furniture were collected between July 15 and October 15, 2020, at COVID-19 intensive and emergency care units. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome was determined by quantitative RT-qPCR. The positivity rate for SARS-Cov-2 genome is presented as the arithmetic mean of the sum of the values obtained in each collection. Values of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.0 were assigned for positive, indeterminate, and negative events, respectively. RESULTS: In the intensive care unit, 86% of samples collected at the stethoscope and bed rail surfaces were positive. In the emergency care unit, 43% of bathroom tap, bed rails, and bedside table samples were positive. SARS-CoV-2 genome was not detected at the computer mouse and keyboard. At the emergency care unit, 14.3% of the samples from the collection room armchair were positive. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 genome can be found at the environmental surface of objects and furniture at COVID-19 care units. They can represent a potential source of indirect transmission pathway for COVID-19, especially within health service institutions."
2,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a new type of coronavirus, has increased the difficulty of studying abroad for basic research. However, the associated system has changed in response to the coronavirus disaster. In addition, a framework has been built to enable research to be conducted even under a new lifestyle. Although there are many differences betwee studying abroad currently and before the pandemic, you should not give up on your dreams; I encourage you to open the door and challenge yourself."
3,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,"Post-Covid pulmonary fibrosis is evident following severe COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify the cellular and pathophysiological characteristics of chronic lung squeals of Covid-19 for the development of future preventive and/or therapeutic interventions. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells can mediate local immune protection against infections and cancer. Less beneficially, lung TRM cells cause chronic airway inflammation and fibrosis by stimulating pathologic inflammation. The effects of Janus kinase (JAK), an inducer pathway of cytokine storm, inhibition on acute Covid-19 cases have been previously evaluated. Here, we propose that Tofacitinib by targeting the CD8(+) TRM cells could be a potential candidate for the treatment of chronic lung diseases induced by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection."
4,Dental and medical problems,"This article describes what changes have had to be made to the functioning of dental practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic and how the pandemic has affected dental staff. Dentists are at high risk of infection and this is associated with fear, including the fear of being infected by their co-workers and patients, or that they will infect their families. The introduced changes include increased protective measures, and the introduction of additional questionnaires and procedures. In dental practices, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been increased and changes have been introduced in the functioning of surgeries in accordance with the recommendations of dental associations and governments. The aforementioned changes have significantly reduced the comfort of dental work, increased the costs of treatment and reduced the availability of dental treatment. A novel solution to this situation has been the implementation of teledentistry, which helps to reduce the number of non-emergency visits. This process involves the remote facilitation of dental treatment by means of technology (i.e., phone or the Internet) without direct contact with the patient. Due to the restrictions implemented during the pandemic, many universities have introduced remote or hybrid teaching for both didactic and practical classes."
5,Current reviews in clinical and experimental pharmacology,"In Covid-19 cases, elderly patients in long-term care facilities, children younger than five years with moderate symptoms, and patients admitted to ICU or with comorbidities are at a high risk of coinfection due to evidence. Thus, in these patients, antibiotic therapy based on empirical evidence is necessary. Finding appropriate antimicrobial agents, especially with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, is a promising approach to target the virus and its complications, hyper-inflammation, and microorganisms resulting co-infection. Moreover, indiscriminate use of antibiotics can be accompanied by Clostridioides difficile colitis, the emergence of resistant microorganisms, and adverse drug reactions, particularly kidney damage and QT prolongation. Therefore, rational administration of efficient antibiotics is an important issue. The main objective of the present review is to provide a summary of antibiotics with possible antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-immunomodulatory effects to guide scientists for further research. Besides, the findings can help health professionals in the rational prescription of antibiotics in Covid-19 patients with a high risk of coinfection."
6,Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) can be seen in a variety of viruses. It has a deleterious impact on antibody treatment of viral infection. This effect was first discovered in the dengue virus, and it has since been discovered in the coronavirus. Over 213 million people have been affected by the rapid spread of the newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The new coronavirus offers a significant threat and has sparked widespread concern. ADE in dengue virus and other viruses are discussed with possible effect on COVID-19 treatment and vaccine development will need to consider this phenomenon to ensure it is mitigated and avoided altogether. In these case scenarios, the role of ADE and its clinical consequences remains to be explored for this newly detected virus."
7,Medical anthropology,"This article shares findings on COVID-19 in Africa across 2020 to examine concepts and practices of epidemic preparedness and response. Amidst uncertainties about the trajectory of COVID-19, the stages of emergency response emerge in practice as interconnected. We illustrate how complex dynamics manifest as diverse actors interpret and modify approaches according to contexts and experiences. We suggest that the concept of ""intersecting precarities"" best captures the temporalities at stake; that these precarities include the effects of epidemic control measures; and that people do not just accept but actively negotiate these intersections as they seek to sustain their lives and livelihoods."
8,PloS one,"The deadliest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is taking thousands of lives worldwide and presents an extraordinary challenge to mental resilience. This study assesses mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among informal waste workers in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020 among 176 informal waste workers selected from nine municipalities and one city corporation in Bangladesh. General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to assess respondents' mental health. The study found that 80.6% of the individuals were suffering from psychological distress; 67.6% reported anxiety and depression, 92.6% reported social dysfunction, and 19.9% reported loss of confidence. The likelihood of psychological distress (Risk ratio [RR]: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.48) was significantly higher for female than male. Multiple COVID-19 symptoms of the family members (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.41), unawareness about COVID-19 infected neighbor (RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.41), income reduction (RR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.06-2.41) and daily household meal reduction (RR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03-1.73) were also found to be associated with psychological distress. These identified factors should be considered in policy-making and support programs for the informal waste workers to manage the pandemic situation as well as combating COVID-19 related psychological challenges."
