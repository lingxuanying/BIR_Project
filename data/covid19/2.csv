METHODS: A cross-sectional study from a COVID facility including women aged 20-45 years with active COVID-19 infection, cervicovaginal secretions were collected from cervix and posterior fornix using dacron swab within 7 days of symptom onset or 5 days of nasopharyngeal rRT-PCR test positivity in asymptomatic women. Cervicovaginal samples of women with mild symptoms were tested using rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in cervicovaginal secretions of any of the 11 women included in the study. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 does not shed in the cervicovaginal secretions of women with mild COVID 19 infection, ruling out sexual and vertical transmission of virus in mild and asymptomatic disease."

8,Infectious disorders drug targets,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-coV-2, which emerged in Wuhan in November 2019, has increasingly spread worldwide. More than 272 million cases of infection have been identified. COVID-19 affects 223 countries and territories across the world. The principal target of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the lower respiratory tract. Series of moderate to non-specific severe clinical signs and symptoms that appear two to fourteen days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can occur in patients with COVID-19 disease. There is cough, breath deficiency, and at least two of these symptoms: headache, fever, chills, repeated rigor, myalgia, oropharyngitis, anosmia, and ageusia. No therapeutic agents have been validated to have substantial efficacy in the clinical care of COVID-19 patients in large-scale trials, despite worsening infected rates in COVID-19. Early clinical evidence from many sources suggests that treatment with famotidine may decrease COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. The mechanism by which famotidine could improve the outcomes of COVID-19 is currently unknown. A more recent postulated mechanism is that the effect of famotidine is mediated by histamine-2 receptor antagonism or inverse agonism, inferring that the SARS-CoV-2, resulting in COVID-19 infection at least partially leads to the abnormal release of histamine and perhaps dysfunction of mast cells."
