0,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"BACKGROUND: Several studies indicate that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted within indoor spaces. Therefore, environmental characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with respect to human activity, building parameters, and environmental mitigation strategies is critical to combat disease transmission. METHODS: We recruited 11 participants diagnosed with COVID-19 to individually occupy a controlled chamber and conduct specified physical activities under a range of environmental conditions; we collected human and environmental samples over a period of three days for each participant. RESULTS: Here we show that increased viral load, measured by lower RNA cycle threshold (CT) values, in nasal samples is associated with higher viral loads in environmental aerosols and on surfaces captured in both the near field (1.2 m) and far field (3.5 m). We also found that aerosol viral load in far field is correlated with the number of particles within the range of 1 microm -2.5 microm. Furthermore, we found that increased ventilation and filtration significantly reduced aerosol and surface viral loads, while higher relative humidity resulted in lower aerosol and higher surface viral load, consistent with an increased rate of particle deposition at higher relative humidity. Data from near field aerosol trials with high expiratory activities suggest that respiratory particles of smaller sizes (0.3 microm -1 microm) best characterize the variance of near field aerosol viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that building operation practices such as ventilation, filtration, and humidification substantially reduce the environmental aerosol viral load, and therefore inhalation dose, and should be prioritized to improve building health and safety."

2,Environmental science and pollution research international,"COVID-19, declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a pandemic, has affected greenhouse gas emissions and contributed to the uncertainty of environmental activities. This study demonstrates the effect of lockdowns, the number of new confirmed cases, and the number of newly confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 on CO2 emissions. The data series used are for the UK from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 and for Spain from 14 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. This research adopted the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for a stationarity check of the data series, the Johansen cointegration test for determining cointegration among variables, and the vector error correction model (VEC) Granger causality test for directional cause and effect between exogenous and endogenous variables. The VEC model shows a bidirectional relationship between CO2 emissions and lockdown and a unidirectional relationship with newly confirmed cases and deaths for the UK. The results of Spain confirmed the unidirectional relationship of CO2 emissions, lockdown, new confirmed cases, and deaths. The Granger causality test reconfirms the relationship of variables except for newly confirmed deaths for the UK and newly confirmed cases for Spain. Conclusively, the pandemic breakout reduced the emission of CO2. The directional relation of variables supported the short-run relationship of CO2 emissions with newly confirmed cases and deaths, while a long- and short-run relationship was shown with lockdown. The directional and relational behavior of lockdown potentially linked the CO2 emissions with daily life activities."
3,Journal of religion and health,"This study examined the association between spiritual quality of life (QoL), spiritual coping, emotional distress, and personality during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in a convenience sample of Croatian adults (n = 2,860, 80.6% women). Participants completed an online questionnaire that collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, distress (the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21), spiritual coping and spiritual QoL (the WHO Quality of Life-Spirituality, Religiousness, and Personal Beliefs), and personality (the International Personality Item Pool). The hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that personality traits, especially emotional stability, were the most significant predictors of mental health outcomes. Spiritual coping styles were a predictor of worse, while spiritual QoL of better psychological outcomes. Results demonstrate the complex relations between different aspects of spirituality/religiosity with personality and emotional outcomes and suggest that distress motivates the engagement of spiritual coping in times of disaster."
4,Recent patents on biotechnology,"The world continues to be in the midst of a distressing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus with multiple antigenic systems. The virus enters via nasopharynx, oral and infects cells by the expression of the spike protein, and enters the lungs using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor. The spectrum of specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is increasingly challenging as frequent mutations have been reported and their antigen specificity varies accordingly. The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will have a more significant advantage in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity. Recently, mAbs have been developed to target specific neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of the therapeutic index of mAbs that can elicit neutralization by binding to the viral spike protein and suppress the cytokine network is a classic therapeutic approach for a potential cure. The development of mAbs against B-cell function as well as inhibition of the cytokine network has also been a focus in recent research. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mAbs as antibody cocktail preparations against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Target specific therapeutic accomplishment with mAbs, a milestone in the modern therapeutic age, can be used to achieve a specific therapeutic strategy to suppress SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. This review focuses on the molecular aspects of the cytokine network and antibody formation to better understand the development of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection."
5,Sleep health,"OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: Cross-sectional study to examine the determinants of sleep health among postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A subset of participants recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) cohort at Columbia University (N = 62 non-Hispanic White, N = 17 African American, N = 107 Hispanic). MEASUREMENTS: Data on maternal sleep, COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors were collected via questionnaire at 4 months postpartum. Self-reported subjective sleep quality, latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances, and daytime dysfunction were examined as categorical variables (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). Associations between sleep variables and COVID-19 status, time of the pandemic, sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors were estimated via independent multivariable regressions. RESULTS: Mothers who delivered between May-December 2020, who delivered after the NYC COVID-19 peak, experienced worse sleep latency, disturbances and global sleep health compared to those who delivered March-April 2020, the peak of the pandemic. Maternal depression, stress and COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress were associated with all sleep domains except for sleep efficiency. Maternal perception of infant's sleep as a problem was associated with worse global PSQI score, subjective sleep quality, duration, and efficiency. Compared to non-Hispanic White, Hispanic mothers reported worse global PSQI scores, sleep latency, duration and efficiency, but less daytime dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide crucial information about sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors contributing to sleep health in the postpartum period."
6,Journal of medical Internet research,"UNSTRUCTURED: In the Czech Republic, the strategic data-based and organisational support for individual regions and for providers of acute care on the nationwide level is coordinated by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country needed to implement very quickly a system for monitoring, reporting and overall management of hospital capacities. This viewpoint paper aims to describe the purpose and basic functions of a web-based application entitled ""Control Centre for Intensive Care"", which has been developed and made available for the needs of systematic online technical support for the management of intensive inpatient care across the Czech Republic during the first wave of pandemic in spring 2020. Two tools of key importance are described in the context of national methodology; namely one module for regular online updates and overall monitoring of currently free capacities of intensive care in real time, and a second module for online entering and overall record keeping of requirements on medications for COVID-19 patients. A total of 134 intensive care providers and 927 users from hospitals from all 14 regions of the Czech Republic were registered in the central Control Centre for Intensive Care database as of 31 March 2021. This web-based application enabled continuous monitoring and decision-making during the mass surge of critical care from autumn 2020 to spring 2021. The Control Centre for Intensive Care has become an indispensable part of a set of online tools that are employed on a regular basis for crisis management at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic."
7,Health physics,"ABSTRACT: Epidemiological evidence and models have demonstrated that the current COVID-19 pandemic introduces a significant public risk to implementing large-scale community evacuations in response to disasters. While guidance documented in the US Environmental Protection Agency Protective Action Guidance (PAG) Manual is widely accepted as the standard basis for public and emergency worker protective actions for a radiological emergency, it is based primarily on assessing the risks associated with the radiological factors alone. However, as demonstrated in response to the nuclear incident in Fukushima, these events seldom occur in isolation from other risk-inducing events. Today, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant public health risk that must also be considered alongside the radiation risks in determining appropriate public and emergency worker protection action decisions. In particular, the significant public health risks associated with community transmission and mortality of COVID-19 challenge our most familiar and rehearsed radiological response strategies. The 1992 and 2017 US Environmental Protection Agency PAG manuals allow for considerations in protective action decision making. Much of the radiation emergency response community has been conditioned through decades of structured training and exercises to focus public protection considerations on specific guidelines referenced numerically in tables within the manual. Discussion regarding adjustment of specific PAG values is provided in the footnotes and bases portions of the PAG manual but is often not included in jurisdictional plans or routinely considered in exercises. However, when properly applied, the protective action guidance provides the necessary flexibility for decision-makers to account for additional public health risks or impediments, and jurisdictions can use this guidance to build a more effective response strategy. The authors have applied the full guidance and flexibility provided in the 2017 US Environmental Protection Agency PAG Manual to develop more specific guidance for their respective jurisdictions' radiation emergency response plans and will outline a process for consideration of protective action decisions to maximize the protection of public health and safety."
8,European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Severe diseases such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, are the result of coronavirus infections and have demonstrated the urgent need for antiviral drugs to combat these deadly viruses. Due to its essential role in viral replication and function, 3CL(pro) (main coronaviruses cysteine-protease) has been identified as a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. Previously reported SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) non-covalent inhibitors were used as a starting point for the development of covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro). We report herein our efforts in the design and synthesis of submicromolar covalent inhibitors when the enzymatic activity of the viral protease was used as a screening platform."
9,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Cancer patients are at increased risk for psychological difficulties and COVID-19. We sought to analyze anxiety and depression levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association between sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter cohort of 401 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, advanced cancer completed the Brief Symptom Inventory, Michel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Herth Hope Index, and Cancer Worry Scale between February 2020 and May 2021. Linear regression analyses explored the effects of uncertainty, hopelessness, and cancer worry on anxiety and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: The incidence of anxiety and depression was 36% and 35%, respectively. Emotional distress was greater among women, patients < 65 years of age, and those with an estimated survival of > 18 months. Linear regression analysis revealed that being female, preoccupation about cancer, and hopelessness were associated with increased levels of anxiety (p < 0.001) and depression (p < 0.001) and younger age was associated with a higher risk of anxiety. No differences in anxiety or depression levels were found in relation to marital status, children, educational level, cancer type, histology, stage, or type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced cancer who initiated treatment during the pandemic experienced high levels of depression and anxiety. Early diagnosis and the development of intervention strategies are necessary, especially for specific patient subgroups, such as young women with long survival times."
