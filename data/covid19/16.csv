0,"Journal of public health (Oxford, England)","BACKGROUND: Despite generally high coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rates in the UK, vaccination hesitancy and lower take-up rates have been reported in certain ethnic minority communities. METHODS: We used vaccination data from the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) linked to the 2011 Census and individual health records for subjects aged >/=40 years (n = 24 094 186). We estimated age-standardized vaccination rates, stratified by ethnic group and key sociodemographic characteristics, such as religious affiliation, deprivation, educational attainment, geography, living conditions, country of birth, language skills and health status. To understand the association of ethnicity with lower vaccination rates, we conducted a logistic regression model adjusting for differences in geographic, sociodemographic and health characteristics. ResultsAll ethnic groups had lower age-standardized rates of vaccination compared with the white British population, whose vaccination rate of at least one dose was 94% (95% CI: 94%-94%). Black communities had the lowest rates, with 75% (74-75%) of black African and 66% (66-67%) of black Caribbean individuals having received at least one dose. The drivers of these lower rates were partly explained by accounting for sociodemographic differences. However, modelled estimates showed significant differences remained for all minority ethnic groups, compared with white British individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Lower COVID-19 vaccination rates are consistently observed amongst all ethnic minorities."
1,Frontiers in psychology,"Background: In a previous study, we demonstrated that the accumulation of parenting stress during prolonged school closures and restrictions on daily activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan indicates the need for mental health intervention for parents at higher risk of parenting stress. However, few studies have focused on parenting stress in other Asian countries, although they have experienced higher numbers of infections. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether parenting stress among caregivers increased across Asia due to school closures and restrictions on activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine whether there were any country-specific, cross-country, or cross-regional risk factors for increased parenting stress. Methods: We conducted an online survey immediately after the number of new cases in India significantly increased (September-November 2020). We measured parenting stress, anxiety, and fear associated with the COVID-19 crisis, as evaluated by the Parenting Stress Index, Short-Form (PSI-SF), and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), across three Asian countries-India (n = 142), Malaysia (n = 69), and Japan (n = 182)-in addition to the United States (n = 203). We also investigated whether respondents had adverse childhood experiences (ACE) as a risk factor for parenting stress. Results: For all countries, we found significant increases in participants' current parenting stress levels, compared to what they recalled regarding their lives before COVID-19-related restrictions and school closures were enacted. Textual analysis qualitatively identified common terms related to parenting stress across all countries. We also found a statistical model that indicated ACE in parents was a critical risk factor for higher parenting stress via increasing anxiety and fear related to the pandemic. Conclusion: These results indicate the need to improve the mental health of caregivers who are at risk for higher levels of parenting stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Asian countries as well as Western countries. These results indicate that there is a need to improve the mental health of caregivers who are at risk for higher levels of parenting stress during the COVID-19 pandemic globally."
2,Health & social care in the community,"The removal of regulatory and reimbursement barriers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States presented opportunities to explore the potential of telehealth to improve access to and use of healthcare among underserved populations. Therefore, we examined factors associated with accessibility and utilisation of telehealth among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement File of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged >/=65 years (n = 5,189), administered from 5 October 2020, through 15 November 2020. Two survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between factors (i.e., socio-demographics, co-morbidities and digital access/literacy) and whether (1) beneficiaries' regular providers offered telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) those being offered telehealth used it. Furthermore, subgroup analyses by residing area and income status were conducted. Of study beneficiaries, 83.6% reported their regular providers offered telehealth during COVID-19. Disparities in accessibility of telehealth by sociodemographic status were observed [e.g., those living in a non-metro area (versus metro) were 7.1% (marginal effect [ME] = -7.1%; p < 0.01) less likely to report accessibility of telehealth]. Beneficiaries who had no access to internet (ME = -8.2%; p < 0.001) and had not participated in video/voice calls/conferencing prior (versus participated) (ME = -6.6%; p < 0.001) were less likely to report having access to telehealth. Among those being offered telehealth services, 43.0% reported using telehealth services. Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black beneficiaries (e.g., Black versus White; ME = 11.3%; p < 0.01) and those with co-morbidities (versus 0-1 condition) (e.g., 2-3 co-morbidities, ME = 7.3%; p < 0.01) were more likely to report using telehealth services when offered. Similar results were observed in the subgroup analyses regarding disparities in accessibility and utilisation of telehealth. The accessibility and utilisation of telehealth have increased amidst the pandemic; however, disparities in accessibility of telehealth were observed. A telehealth triage protocol is needed to ensure underserved patients continue to receive appropriate care."

4,JMIR formative research,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are evident, particularly among the first responders and the healthcare staff. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the prevalence and the potential predictors of the likely stress, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder among healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was used through a survey link sent to gather demographic information and responses on several self-report scales, including the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among HCWs subscribed to the Text4Hope program. RESULTS: The result from this study suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs reported high likelihood of moderate/high stress (n=840, 81.2%), moderate/severe anxiety (n=369, 38.6%), and depression (n=317, 32.7%) symptoms. Nurses and other HCWs were significantly more likely to report depressive symptoms, compared to physicians, (F (2, 159.47) =15.89, 95% CI= (-5.05) -(-2.04). Younger age groups of HCWs (</=30 y) were more prone to report likely stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, compared to HCWs 41-50y and >50y (Odd's ratio range: 1.82- 3.03). Similarly, females and those who reported a lack of social support (separated/divorced and single) among HCWs, had a higher likelihood to report likely stress and depressive symptoms, respectively (OR=1.8 and 1.6). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study explored a high level of mental health burdens during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in Alberta. Levels of psychological symptoms were more noticeable in the female gender and the nursing profession. CLINICALTRIAL: The University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board provided ethics approval for this research (Pro00086163)."
5,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine","The role of micronutrient deficiency in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has been reviewed in the literature; however, the data are limited and conflicting. This study investigated the association between the status of essential metals, vitamins, and antioxidant enzyme activities in COVID-19 patients and disease severity. We recruited 155 patients, who were grouped into four classes based on the Adults guideline for the Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 at King Faisal Specialist & Research Centre (KFSH&RC): asymptomatic (N = 16), mild (N = 49), moderate (N = 68), and severe (N = 22). We measured serum levels of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), vitamin D3, vitamin A, vitamin E, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Among the patients, 30%, 25%, 37%, and 68% were deficient in Se (< 70.08 microg/L), Zn (< 0.693 microg/mL), vitamin A (< 0.343 microg/mL), and vitamin D3 (< 20.05 microg/L), respectively, and SOD activity was low. Among the patients, 28% had elevated Cu levels (> 1.401 microg/mL, KFSH&RC upper reference limit). Multiple regression analysis revealed an 18% decrease in Se levels in patients with severe symptoms, which increased to 30% after adjusting the model for inflammatory markers. Regardless of inflammation, Se was independently associated with COVID-19 severity. In contrast, a 50% increase in Cu levels was associated with disease severity only after adjusting for C-reactive protein, reflecting its possible inflammatory and pro-oxidant role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We noted an imbalance in the ratio between Cu and Zn, with ~ 83% of patients having a Cu/Zn ratio > 1, which is an indicator of inflammation. Cu-to-Zn ratio increased to 45% in patients with mild symptoms and 34%-36% in patients with moderate symptoms compared to asymptomatic patients. These relationships were only obtained when one of the laboratory parameters (lymphocyte or monocyte) or inflammatory markers (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) was included in the regression model. These findings suggest that Cu/Zn might further exacerbate inflammation in COVID-19 patients and might be synergistically associated with disease severity. A 23% decrease in vitamin A was seen in patients with severe symptoms, which disappeared after adjusting for inflammatory markers. This finding may highlight the potential role of inflammation in mediating the relationship between COVID-19 severity and vitamin A levels. Despite our patients' low status of Zn, vitamin D3, and antioxidant enzyme (SOD), there is no evidence of their role in COVID-19 progression. Our findings reinforce that deficiency or excess of certain micronutrients plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. More studies are required to support our results."
6,Frontiers in psychiatry,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted severe restrictions on everyday life to curb the spread of infections. For example, teaching at universities has been switched to an online format, reducing students' opportunities for exchange, and social interaction. Consequently, their self-reported mental health has significantly decreased and there is a pressing need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms-ideally considering not only data collected during the pandemic, but also before. One hundred seventeen German university students aged 18-27 were assessed for known resilience factors (optimism, self-care, social support, generalized self-efficacy) and subsequently completed surveys on stress experiences and mental health every 3 months over a period of 9 months before the outbreak of the pandemic and once during the first lockdown in Germany. For each timepoint before the pandemic, we regressed participants' mental health against the reported stressor load, such that the resulting residuals denote better or worse than expected outcomes, i.e., the degree of resilient functioning. We then tested whether different expressions in the resilience factors were predictive of distinct resilient functioning trajectories, which were identified through latent class growth analysis. Finally, we investigated whether trajectory class, resilience factors, and perceived stress predicted resilience during the pandemic. Results show rather stable resilient functioning trajectories, with classes differing mainly according to degree rather than change over time. More self-care was associated with a higher resilient functioning trajectory, which in turn was linked with the most favorable pandemic response (i.e., lower perceived stress and more self-care). Although findings should be interpreted with caution given the rather small sample size, they represent a rare examination of established resilience factors in relation to resilience over an extended period and highlight the relevance of self-care in coping with real-life stressors such as the pandemic."
7,Journal of European CME,"The digitisation of society has reached almost every facet of our daily lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has further showcased the role of information and communications technology (ICT) in society and so much so in continuing medical education (CME). This has provided the CME industry with remarkable opportunities to design better educational programmes and reach more audiences. However, for healthcare professionals to take full advantage of these developments, they need to be digitally competent, at least at a basic level. While digital competence influences CME uptake in the internet age, several factors, in turn, can influence digital competence. These factors come from both within and outside the influence of healthcare professionals and educators. In this article, we explore how digital competence influences CME uptake and recommend ways to improve digital competence among healthcare professionals."
8,Advances in radiation oncology,"Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine became an attractive alternative to in-person appointments. The role of telemedicine in patients who undergo frequent on-site treatment, such as radiation therapy, is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine telemedicine use, physician satisfaction, and barriers to continued use in radiation oncology. Methods and Materials: An anonymous, electronic survey was distributed to radiation oncologists internationally between June and October 2020. Respondents described demographic and practice characteristics, and a 5-point Likert scale assessed provider satisfaction, ease of use, and overall utility of telemedicine. Analyses include descriptive statistics and subgroup comparisons using the chi(2) test and Fisher's exact test. Results: The response rate was 4.3%. Two hundred thirty-two respondents completed the survey, 63.8% of whom were male, 52.6% aged 50 or younger, and 78.0% from the United States. Only 14.2% used telemedicine previously, which increased to 93.1% during COVID-19. Among all telemedicine users, usage rates were 77.9% for initial consultations, 97.2% for follow-up visits, and 35.9% for on-treatment visits. Of the respondents, 69.8% reported that <25% of patients requiring treatment experienced delays due to COVID-19. Most conducted appointments from the workplace, with 40.1% also doing so from home. Satisfaction was high at 73.8%, perceived usefulness was 76.9%, and 81.5% hope to continue using telemedicine after the pandemic. However, 82.4% had concerns with the inability to examine patients and 63.0% had concerns about poor patient access to the required technology. In addition, 49.5% had concerns regarding continued billing/reimbursement, less commonly at government centers (18.8%) compared with academic/satellite facilities (52.7%) and free-standing centers/community hospitals (50.7%, P = .039 for both comparisons). These concerns were also significantly higher among US physicians (53.2% vs 34.9%, P = .048). Conclusions: Widespread adoption of telemedicine by radiation oncologists occurred during COVID-19 with high rates of satisfaction and interest in continued use. Sustained reimbursement for telemedicine services is a significant concern, particularly in the United States and outside of government facilities."
9,Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Innovative surveillance methods are needed to assess adherence to COVID-19 social distancing and stay-at-home order/self-quarantine recommendations, especially methods that can provide near real-time and/or highly geographically targeted data. Use of location-based social media image data is one possible approach that could be explored to address this problem. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether publicly-available near real-time social media images might be used to monitor COVID-19 health policy adherence. METHODS: We collected a sample of 43,487 Instagram images in New York from February 7 to April 11, 2020 from the following location hashtags: #Centralpark (N = 20,937); #Brooklyn Bridge (N = 14,875); and #Timesquare (N = 7,675). After manually reviewing images for accuracy, we counted and recorded the frequency of valid daily posts at each of these hashtag locations over time, as well as rated and counted whether the individuals in the pictures at these location hashtags were social distancing (i.e., whether the individuals in the images appeared to be distanced from others versus next to or touching each other). We analyzed the number of images posted over time and the correlation between trends among hashtag locations. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant decline in the number of posts over time across all regions, with an approximate decline of 17% across each site (p< .001). We found a positive correlation between hashtags (#Centralpark,#Brooklynbridge; r=.40), (#BrooklynBridge,#Timesquare; r=.41), (#Timesquare,#Centralpark; r=.33; p< .001 for all correlations). The logistic regression analysis showed a mild statistically significant increase in the proportion of posts over time with people appearing to be social distancing at Times Square (p<.05) and Brooklyn Bridge (p < .05), but not for Central Park. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the potential of using location-based social media image data as a method for surveillance of COVID-19 health policy adherence. Future studies should further explore the implementation and ethical issues associated with this approach. CLINICALTRIAL:"
