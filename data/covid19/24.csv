However, extra-pulmonary complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are increasingly being recognized. In this regard, some studies implied the hemostatic and vascular involvements in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 and history of cesarean section a week before the occurrence of ICH. The patient underwent emergent craniotomy with acceptable outcome. Hemorrhagic events, including ICH, may happen during COVID-19 infection with several possible mechanisms. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients, especially high-risk groups, are at a risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, close follow-up must be maintained and hemorrhagic events must be kept in mind in these cases."

5,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,"A new coronavirus emerged in 2019 in Wuhan, China named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Later, this virus spread worldwide, causing a disease called coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To control the outbreak, many countries announced mandatory quarantine; thus, people changed their lifestyles and started engaging in most activities from home. This review explains how some dermatological pathologies may be precipitated by prolonged stays at home, considering that quarantine was a widely used public health measure during 2020. Most of these dermatoses had to be seen, diagnosed, and treated through tele-dermatology, a remote health care system that took force during the COVID-19 pandemic because of its ease and efficiency in connecting health care professionals and their patients; therefore, reducing the risk of contagion and costs associated to medical care. This review of the principal dermatologic conditions during confinement could allow for a better preparation of health professionals."

7,Psychological reports,"While at first the fear of COVID-19 disease spread was limited by the fact that the pandemic appeared to be confined to China, the growing emergency in Italy and the rapid escalation in positive cases and deaths have made the threat of this disease a national as well as global phenomenon. In the present research, a questionnaire was collected both before (n = 396) and during (n = 250) the outbreak of the pandemic in Italy. The aim of the research was to analyze the possible mediation of binding moral foundations on the relationship between concerns over COVID-19 and prejudice vis-a-vis immigrants. As hypothesized, the results show that concerns over COVID-19 increased greatly after the start of the Italian pandemic. Moreover, both before and during the pandemic, the relationship between concerns over COVID-19 and prejudice toward immigrants is mediated by binding moral foundations."
8,Journal of infection and public health,"There is a global demand for rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the interest in their clinical compliance is growing. In this study, we evaluated the clinical compliance of seven different severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen RDTs. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19-confirmed cases and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) screening were used to evaluate the performance of seven RDTs. Using the RT-PCR and RDT results, we predicted the cycle threshold (Ct) of each target gene (E, RdRP, and N genes) which 50% (Ct50) and 95% (Ct95) detection rates were achieved in the RDTs. A total of 482 specimens were enrolled in our study: 316 specimens from COVID-19-confirmed cases and 166 RT-PCR-negative specimens. The median values of Ct50 and Ct95 for the seven RDTs were in the ranges of ranged 24.3-30.9 and 19.3-22.6 for E, 25.5-31.5 and 20.9-24.0 for RdRP, and 26.8-32.3 and 22.7-25.7 for N, respectively. The RDTs showed acceptable compliance only for specimens with high viral burdens (Ct < 20). However, the false-negative rate increased by more than 50% for most of the RDTs in low-viral burden specimens (Ct> 30). These results suggest that RDTs should not be used without molecular assays for COVID-19 screening for asymptomatic patients because of their high false-negative rates."
9,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,"We surveyed healthcare workers at one urban academic hospital in the U.S. about their confidence in and knowledge of appropriate personal protective equipment use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 461 respondents, most were confident and knowledgeable about use; prescribers or nurses and those extremely confident about use were most knowledgeable."
