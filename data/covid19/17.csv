0,"Child: care, health and development","BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the United States in the spring and summer of 2020, many organizations serving children and youth immediately faced significant operational and health care challenges. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for the safe operation of youth programs emphasized the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), yet few studies have examined NPI usage in summer programs such as camps. METHOD: This sequential-explanatory mixed-methods study explored the utilization of NPIs among camp health care providers who completed an online questionnaire followed by one-on-one interviews. RESULTS: The study findings indicated that camps consistently used a core set of NPIs to maintain and protect the health of camp participants, including screening, cohorting, hand hygiene, sanitizing practices, ventilation, and physical distancing. The study findings further identified specific practices of camp health care providers that made NPI utilization possible, as exemplified in the emergent themes of wellness promotion; health awareness and modeling; and camp health service mobilization. CONCLUSION: NPI usage benchmarks from this study, as well as effective practices for NPI utilization, can inform the application of NPIs and other health-promoting practices across diverse formal and informal youth settings."
1,Psychology research and behavior management,"Purpose: Literature shows that it is a paradox whether employees can achieve performance in telework, especially during COVID-19. Our aim is to clarify the relationship between telework and employees' job performance through a moderated mediation model. Methods: This study employed two-wave surveys with the aim of reducing the potential risk of common method bias. The 1309 participants of the survey were mainly employees who used telework during COVID-19, and they were mostly in positions such as product design and scheme planning. SEM was used to test the hypotheses. Results: Results from two-wave surveys of 1309 Chinese employees indicated that telework positively influenced job performance via job crafting. That is, job crafting played a mediating role between telework and job performance. And performance-prove goal orientation positively moderated the relationship between telework and job crafting but performance-avoid goal orientation negatively moderated the relationship between them. Conclusion: This study shows that telework can improve job performance through job crafting in COVID-19, in response to the paradox implied in the literature. In addition, we use COR theory to explain the role of performance goal orientation and job crafting in telework. We add these variables to the theoretical framework of COR theory, thereby enriching the theoretical research from the COR theory perspective."
2,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),"PURPOSE: The aim of this observational study was to highlight high resolution CT scan characteristics of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) with a focus on the detection of de-novo appeared or evolved bronchiectasis. METHODS: From March 2020 to May 2021, we enrolled 350 consecutive mechanically ventilated ICU patients with COVID-19. Patients with CAPA and at least one chest CT scan performed within 15 days from the diagnosis were included. Two radiologists were asked to identify typical and atypical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bronchiectasis locations were described and a modified Reiff score was calculated, as severity score. A total of 19 CAPA patients (median age 71.0, Interquartile range (IQR) 62.5-75.0; male 16, 84.2%) were included. RESULTS: According to the 2020 ECMM/ISHAM criteria, 18 patients had probable CAPA and one had proven CAPA. The median time between hospital admission and CT scan was 21 days (IQR 14.5-25.0). The incidence of bronchiectasis in the study population was 57.9% (n = 11). Tubular bronchiectasis was detected in 10 patients and were scored as follows: three patients had a score of 1, three patients had a score of score 2, one patient had a score of 5 and four patients had a score of 6. Eight patients had a previous CT scan (performed at hospital admission), among them: 5 patients developed de-novo bronchiectasis, while 2 patients demonstrated a volumetric increase of bronchiectasis. At the 6-months follow-up, the mortality rate for patients with CAPA was >60%. CONCLUSION: the radiologic detection of de-novo appearance or volumetric increase of bronchiectasis in COVID-19 should lead clinicians to search for fungal superinfections."
3,European heart journal. Case reports,"Background: Postural tachycardia syndrome (PTS) is a novel identified sequela of COVID-19 infection. This observational study describes clinical presentation, testing, and treatment response in seven patients diagnosed with PTS following COVID-19 infection. Case summary: A total of seven active patients (three collegiate athletes, one recreational athlete, two registered nurses, one hospitality employee), age 24 +/- 6 years, and six females were followed for a mean of 152 +/- 105 days after contracting COVID-19. Tilt table was performed to establish the diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms were palpitations (7/7), dyspnoea (6/7), and gastrointestinal complaints (5/7). One patient required hospitalization for symptom management. The mean latency of PTS onset following COVID-19 was 21 +/- 15 days. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) demonstrated sinus rhythm in all patients, one with resting sinus tachycardia. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal systolic and diastolic left ventricular function in all patients. On tilt table testing, baseline heart rate (HR) was 72 +/- 12 with maximum HR reaching 136 +/- 13. Six of seven patients failed to respond to supportive therapy alone, and two patients failed medical management with ivabradine, midodrine, and/or metoprolol. Of three severely symptomatic patients, two demonstrated some degree of clinical recovery with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Discussion: This novel case series describes the development of PTS in the context of COVID-19 infection. Severity of symptoms and response to treatment was heterogeneous. Interestingly, patients were poorly responsive to traditional PTS treatments, but IVIG showed potential as a possible therapeutic strategy for refractory PTS in two patients, particularly following COVID-19 infection."
4,Applied psychology. Health and well-being,"The COVID-19 lockdowns represent a major life event with an immense impact on university students' lives. Findings prior to the pandemic suggest that changes in personality and subjective well-being (SWB) can occur after critical life events or psychological interventions. The present study examined how university students' extraversion, neuroticism, and SWB changed during two COVID-19 lockdowns in Germany. To this end, we conducted a partly preregistered, two-cohort study with four measurement points each from October 2019 to May 2021 (NStudy 1 = 81-148, NStudy 2 = 82-97). We used both multilevel contrast analyses and multi-group random-intercept cross-lagged panel models to examine within-person changes over time. Levels of life satisfaction, extraversion, and, unexpectedly, neuroticism were lower during both lockdowns. Students' affect improved during the first but deteriorated during the second lockdown, suggesting that similar experiences with the deceleration of daily life were associated with different affective outcomes during the two lockdown periods. Following the introduction or termination of a lockdown, changes in extraversion (neuroticism) were consistently positively (negatively) associated with changes in SWB. Our results stress the importance of disentangling between- and within-person processes and using pre-COVID baseline levels to examine changes in personality and SWB."
5,European journal of psychotraumatology,"Background: The management of the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is all the more difficult when subjects suffer from a prior psychiatric illness. BV13 is a 54-month prospective longitudinal cohort study of 111 subjects who were present in the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 terrorist attack in Paris. Objectives: Our first objective was to investigate the association between stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic and PTSD symptoms, notably with respect to two positive risk factors: trait mindfulness and social support. The second was to explore how PTSD severity mediated the relationship between trait mindfulness and COVID-19-induced stress. Method: The primary endpoint was evaluated using the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the PTSD Check List Scale (PCL-5) during the sanitary crisis and two years before. Social support was assessed with a Likert scale that measured perceived support from family, friends and the workplace. Trait mindfulness was measured with the 14-item Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). Results: 54 months after the attack, a univariate analysis identified a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 stress (CPDI) and PCL-5 (r=0.77, p<0.01) scores, on the one hand, and significant negative correlations with FMI (r=-0.59, p<0.01), and social support (r=-0.28, p<0.01) scores, on the other hand. In the multivariate model, CPDI scores were closely associated with PCL-5 scores (p<0.01) after adjustment for FMI and social support scores. CPDI and FMI scores were significantly associated (p=0.05), but not CPDI and social support scores (p=0.89). The PTSD score was a strong mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness (FMI) and COVID-19 stress (CPDI) scores. Conclusion: PTSD symptoms diminished the beneficial impact of trait mindfulness on stress related to COVID-19. Our finding highlights that subjects with previous experience of trauma need specific treatment for PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis."
6,PeerJ,"Background: COVID-related restrictions impacted the lives of students on and off campus during Academic Year 2020/2021. Methods: Our study collected data on student health behavior and habits as well as their mental and emotional health using anonymous surveys. We compared these data with data collected prior to COVID in the longitudinal part of our study (n = 721) and analyzed them for the cross-sectional part of the study (n = 506). Results: The longitudinal data show a significant difference for some student behaviors and habits, such as sleeping habits, physical activity, breakfast consumption, time spent online or playing video games, vaping, and marijuana use, during the COVID pandemic compared with pre-COVID data. Respondents also reported a significant increase in difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions, as well as being impacted by feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Yet, there was no increase in the proportion of respondents considering, planning or attempting suicide during COVID. The cross-sectional data illuminate the negative effect of the overall situation and the restrictions on students' mental and emotional well-being. Three-quarters of respondents reported having craved human interaction during the past six months, more than half felt that their mental/emotional health had been impacted by the lack of social events or the switch to virtual (online) teaching. Two-thirds or more of respondents also expressed that they felt less connected to their peers and less motivated in their studies than in previous semesters. Fifty percent or more of respondents selected anxious, stressed, overwhelmed, disconnected, tired, and fatigued as words that best described their emotional state during the pandemic. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-related restrictions on students' behaviors and habits as well as their mental and emotional health was less severe than one would have expected based on studies during the early stage of the pandemic. While some behaviors and habits changed during the COVID pandemic compared with the pre-COVID period, the changes were not substantial overall. Our study did not find an increase in the proportion of respondents considering, planning or attempting suicide during COVID, although the cross-sectional data from our survey make the negative effect of the overall situation and the restrictions on students' mental and emotional well-being evident. The impact of the pandemic will unquestionably be long-lasting and will necessitate further and future investigations."
7,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","BACKGROUND: The impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination response is uncertain. METHODS: Post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination blood samples across multiple DMTs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) response. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-two people with MS were included; 91.9% received an mRNA vaccine. Post-vaccination reactive IgG rates (IgG index > 1) were 40% for anti-CD20 (32/80 patients); 41% for sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1PRM, 16/39); and 100% for all other classes, including the no DMT group. CONCLUSION: Anti-CD20 therapies and S1PRMs reduce IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; IgG response is preserved with other DMTs."
8,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],"OBJECTIVE: To assess the change in inpatient radiotherapy related to COVID-19 lockdown measures during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. METHODS: We included cases hospitalized between January 1 and August 31, 2018-2020, with a primary ICD-10 diagnosis of C00-C13, C32 (head and neck cancer, HNC) and C53 (cervical cancer, CC). Data collection was conducted within the Medical Informatics Initiative. Outcomes were fractions and admissions. Controlling for decreasing hospital admissions during holidays, calendar weeks of 2018/2019 were aligned to Easter 2020. A lockdown period (LP; 16/03/2020-02/08/2020) and a return-to-normal period (RNP; 04/05/2020-02/08/2020) were defined. The study sample comprised a control (admission 2018/19) and study cohort (admission 2020). We computed weekly incidence and IR ratios from generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: We included 9365 (CC: 2040, HNC: 7325) inpatient hospital admissions from 14 German university hospitals. For CC, fractions decreased by 19.97% in 2020 compared to 2018/19 in the LP. In the RNP the reduction was 28.57% (p< 0.001 for both periods). LP fractions for HNC increased by 10.38% (RNP: 9.27%; p< 0.001 for both periods). Admissions for CC decreased in both periods (LP: 10.2%, RNP: 22.14%), whereas for HNC, admissions increased (LP: 2.25%, RNP: 1.96%) in 2020. Within LP, for CC, radiotherapy admissions without brachytherapy were reduced by 23.92%, whereas surgery-related admissions increased by 20.48%. For HNC, admissions with radiotherapy increased by 13.84%, while surgery-related admissions decreased by 11.28% in the same period. CONCLUSION: Related to the COVID-19 lockdown in an inpatient setting, radiotherapy for HNC treatment became a more frequently applied modality, while admissions of CC cases decreased."
9,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,"BackgroundSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease has frequently been compared with seasonal influenza, but this comparison is based on little empirical data.AimThis study compares in-hospital outcomes for patients with community-acquired COVID-19 and patients with community-acquired influenza in Switzerland.MethodsThis retrospective multi-centre cohort study includes patients > 18 years admitted for COVID-19 or influenza A/B infection determined by RT-PCR. Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission for patients with COVID-19 or influenza. We used Cox regression (cause-specific and Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models) to account for time-dependency and competing events with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounders.ResultsIn 2020, 2,843 patients with COVID-19 from 14 centres were included. Between 2018 and 2020, 1,381 patients with influenza from seven centres were included; 1,722 (61%) of the patients with COVID-19 and 666 (48%) of the patients with influenza were male (p < 0.001). The patients with COVID-19 were younger (median 67 years; interquartile range (IQR): 54-78) than the patients with influenza (median 74 years; IQR: 61-84) (p < 0.001). A larger percentage of patients with COVID-19 (12.8%) than patients with influenza (4.4%) died in hospital (p < 0.001). The final adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio for mortality was 3.01 (95% CI: 2.22-4.09; p < 0.001) for COVID-19 compared with influenza and 2.44 (95% CI: 2.00-3.00, p < 0.001) for ICU admission.ConclusionCommunity-acquired COVID-19 was associated with worse outcomes compared with community-acquired influenza, as the hazards of ICU admission and in-hospital death were about two-fold to three-fold higher."
