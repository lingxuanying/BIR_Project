0,Precision clinical medicine,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted almost every part of human life worldwide, posing a massive threat to human health. The lack of time for new drug discovery and the urgent need for rapid disease control to reduce mortality have led to a search for quick and effective alternatives to novel therapeutics, for example drug repurposing. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA-approved drugs and preclinical small-molecule compounds by integrating gene expression perturbation data for chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures project with a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (GEO: GSE145926, public data available and accessed on 22 April 2020). We identified 281 FDA-approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 16 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. We experimentally tested and demonstrated the inhibitory effects of tyrphostin-AG-1478 and brefeldin-a, two chemical inhibitors of glycosylation (a post-translational modification) on the replication of the single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) virus influenza A virus as well as on the transcription and translation of host cell cytokines and their regulators (IFNs and ISGs). In conclusion, we have identified and experimentally validated repurposable anti-SARS-CoV-2 and IAV drugs using a systems biology approach, which may have the potential for treating these viral infections and their complications (sepsis)."

5,International journal of general medicine,"Over the last few decades, there have been several global outbreaks of severe respiratory infections. The causes of these outbreaks were coronaviruses that had infected birds, mammals and humans. The outbreaks predominantly caused respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract symptoms and other mild to very severe clinical signs. The current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a rapidly spreading illness affecting millions of people worldwide. Among the countries most affected by the disease are the United States of America (USA), India, Brazil, and Russia, with France recording the highest infection, morbidity, and mortality rates. Since early January 2021, thousands of articles have been published on COVID-19. Most of these articles were consistent with the reports on the mode of transmission, spread, duration, and severity of the sickness. Thus, this review comprehensively discusses the most critical aspects of COVID-19, including etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical signs, transmission, pathological changes, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control, and vaccination."

In many countries, general people reported the high level of depression, anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder during recent a pandemic. This study aims to investigate the mental health status of people who survived through this alarming situation of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, seventy individuals (either gender) between the age of 18-60 years, who contracted COVID-19 previously and then recovered as indicated by negative PCR results, were included. Data was collected by using three tools: impact of event scale (IES-R), patient health questionnaire-9(PHQ-9) and corona anxiety scale (CAS). People with other systemic/mental disorders, ongoing malignancies, upper/lower motor disorders and inability to give consent were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 26.29 + 11.79. All the 70 responders suffered from COVID-19. Among these 23 (32.9%) were asymptomatic and 47(67.1%) had common symptoms related to COVID-19 53 (75.7%) responders also had symptoms post-recovery. Most of the people who suffered COVID-19 had mild depression. Twenty-nine participants (41.4%) reported the highest impact of this traumatic event on their mental health. After suffering from COVID-19, 74.3% reported no anxiety as measured through corona anxiety scale (CAS). CONCLUSION: High level of post-traumatic stress was seen among participants who recovered from COVID-19, especially those patients who were symptomatic. Mild depression and anxiety were also noted among them."
9,The Science of the total environment,"The use of face masks outside the health care facility dates back a century ago. However, face masks use noticeably soared due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. As a result, an unprecedented influx of discarded face masks is ending up in the environment. This review paper delves into face masks in the environment using the DPSIR (driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, and responses) framework to simplify and communicate the environmental indicators. Firstly, the historical, and briefly the economic trajectory of face masks are discussed. Secondly, the main driving forces of face masks use with an emphasis on public health are explored. Then, the pressures exerted by efforts to fulfill the human needs (driving forces) are explored. In turn, the state of the environment due to the influx of masks along with the impacts are examined. Furthermore, the upstream, and downstream societal responses to mitigate the environmental damages of the driving forces, pressures, states, and impacts are reviewed. In summary, it has been shown from this review that the COVID-19 pandemic has been causing a surge in face mask usage, which translates to face masks pollution in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. This implies proper usage and disposal of face masks is paramount to the quality of human health and the environment, respectively. Moreover, further research on eco-friendly face masks is indispensable to mitigating the environmental damages occurring due to the mass use of surgical masks worldwide."
