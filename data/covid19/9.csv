0,American journal of perinatology,"Objective The study aimed to report a COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in a neonate found to have an atypical diffuse thickening in coronary artery walls, whose diagnosis required a multi-imaging approach. Study Design A neonate presented at birth with multiple organ involvement and coronary artery anomalies. A diagnosis of MIS-C associated to COVID-19 was supported by maternal Sars-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, and by the presence of both IgG against Sars-CoV-2 and Spike-specific memory B cells response in the neonatal blood. Other plausible causes of the multiple organ involvement were excluded. Result At admission, a severe coronary artery dilatation was identified on echocardiography, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C Kawasaki-like disease; however, coronary artery internal diameters were found to be normal using cardiac computed tomography angiography. At discharge, comparing the two imaging techniques each other, the correct diagnosis resulted to be an abnormal thickening in coronary arterial walls. These findings suggest that the inflammatory process affecting the coronary arterial wall in MIS-C could result not only in typical coronary artery lesions such as dilatation of the lumen or aneurysms development, but also in abnormal thickening of the coronary artery wall. Conclusion. Our case provides an alert for paediatric cardiologists about the complexity to assess coronary artery involvement in MIS-C, and raises the question of whether an abnormal vascular remodeling, with normal inner diameters, is to be considered like coronary artery dilatation for risk stratification."
1,Annual review of public health,"Health care workers (HCWs) can acquire infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from patients. Herein, COVID-19 is used with the source-pathway-receptor framework as an example to assess evidence for the role of aerosol transmission and indirect contact transmission of viral respiratory infectious diseases. Evidence for both routes is strong for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, but aerosol transmission is likely dominant for COVID-19. Key knowledge gaps about transmission processes and control strategies include the distribution of viable virus among respiratory aerosols of different sizes, the mechanisms and efficiency by which virus deposited on the facial mucous membrane moves to infection sites inside the body, and the performance of source controls such as face coverings and aerosol containment devices. To ensure that HCWs are adequately protected from infection, guidelines and regulations must be updated to reflect the evidence that respiratory viruses are transmitted via aerosols. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 43 is April 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
2,Frontiers in immunology,"The ongoing COVID-19 vaccine rollout is critical for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, massive disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations, including people living with HIV. Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised individuals. This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine expressing Spike protein (A.1) from SARS-CoV-2 (repRNA-CoV2S) in immunocompromised, SIV infected and immune competent, naive pigtail macaques. Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and naive animals. Furthermore, vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior to immunization. This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and other immunocompromised individuals."
3,"Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to observe the association between the presence of hypertension with Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among healthcare workers who received CoronaVac vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia on 155 healthcare workers aged 18-59 years old who already received twice of the CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Science, Beijing, China) injection with 14-day intervals. Hypertension was diagnosed according to the 2020 International Society of Hypertension. Subjects were monitored for six months. The primary outcome was the rate of Covid-19 diagnosed by the pharyngeal swab for the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination. The secondary endpoints were: (1) severity of Covid-19 among infected participants; (2) rate of hospitalizations; and (3) anti-SRBD antibody levels measured by ECLIA. RESULTS: Among 155 participants, 18.7% of them were diagnosed with hypertension, and 31.0% had the desirable BP target according to the current guidelines. Subjects with hypertension, especially those with uncontrolled blood pressure, had a higher incidence of Covid-19 infection than subjects without hypertension. Subjects with symptomatic Covid-19 and hospitalized because of Covid-19 were higher in participants with hypertension. The anti-SRBD antibody levels were lower in the second month after CoronaVac vaccination in hypertensive subjects. In contrast, comparable anti-SRBD levels were seen from both groups at sixth months after vaccination. CONCLUSION: Hypertension was associated with lower vaccine effectiveness in healthcare workers. Subjects with hypertension had a higher risk of being infected with Covid-19 despite getting a complete dose of vaccination and lower antibody production."

5,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,"Europe has experienced a large COVID-19 wave caused by the Delta variant in winter 2021/22. Using mathematical models applied to Metropolitan France, we find that boosters administered to >/=65, >/=50 or >/=18 year-olds may reduce the hospitalisation peak by 25%, 36% and 43% respectively, with a delay of 5 months between second and third dose. A 10% reduction in transmission rates might further reduce it by 41%, indicating that even small increases in protective behaviours may be critical to mitigate the wave."
6,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted researchers' ability to continue to deliver HIV prevention and treatment interventions face to face. Although telehealth has been an important strategy to maintain research operations during the current pandemic, participants at increased risk of or living with HIV are often at higher risk of also experiencing poverty, housing instability, and other challenges that may present obstacles to successful remote delivery. Methods: We provide descriptions of remote adaptations to two randomized controlled efficacy trials of behavioral interventions for primary and secondary HIV prevention with descriptive enrollment and retention data. Results and Conclusions: Best practices for implementing telemedicine and e-health procedures are discussed, including procedures for addressing remote participation barriers (economic, health literacy, etc.) and other challenges, such as building rapport and staff support (NCT03092531 and NCT03175159)."

However, it is unclear how suicidal ideation was affected in communities during the acute lockdown phase of the pandemic, and over the longer-term. This study provides longitudinal data on the prevalence of, and risk factors for, suicidal ideation in the Australian national population, during the pandemic. METHOD: The Australian National COVID-19 Mental Health and Risk Communication Survey assessed a nationally representative sample of Australian adults (N=1296) fortnightly for 12 weeks from late-March to June 2020 (7 waves), and again in March 2021 (wave 8). Cox proportional hazards models examined demographic and pandemic-related risk factors for suicidal ideation over time. RESULTS: Prevalence of suicidal ideation was high but steady at approximately 18% across the acute lockdown phase of the pandemic, and 16.2% in March 2021. People who had direct experience with COVID-19 (tested, diagnosed, or contact with someone who was diagnosed) had increased risk for suicidal ideation. Higher pandemic-related work and social impairment, recent adversity, loneliness, and being younger were also associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation over time. CONCLUSION: Both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 were associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation over time, although prevalence did not vary over time. The high prevalence of suicidal ideation in our sample flag a critical need for accessible mental health support, and provide insight into the factors placing people at risk during the pandemic."
9,European journal of psychotraumatology,"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a variety of stressors. Preliminary research has demonstrated that general public are experiencing a range of psychological problems, including stress-related disturbances. However, to date, there is not much research on the prevalence of adjustment disorder during the current pandemic. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder compared to posttraumatic symptoms, depression and generalized anxiety in a large sample of adult Poles, in the first phase of the current pandemic. Method: Self-report data from a web-based sample (N = 1,742) was collected between March 25 and April 27, just after the introduction of nationwide quarantine measures in Poland. Results: The current COVID-19 pandemic was a highly stressful event for 75% of participants and the strongest predictor of adjustment disorder. Increased symptoms of adjustment disorder were reported by 49%, and they were associated with female gender and not having a full-time job. However, after exclusion of co-occurring symptomatology, 14% of the sample were finally qualified as meeting diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder. A substantial proportion of the sample screened also positive for generalized anxiety (44%) and depression (26%); the rate for presumptive PTSD diagnosis was 2.4%. Conclusions: High rates of negative mental health outcomes were found in the Polish population in the first weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. They indicate the intense current stress-related symptoms in the early phase of the pandemic and warrant further monitoring on population's mental health."
