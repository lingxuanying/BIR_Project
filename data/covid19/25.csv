Therefore, we aim to investigate the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in liver transplant (LT) recipients after COVID-19. DESIGN: Prospective multicentre case-control study, analysing antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein, spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and their neutralising activity in LT recipients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19-LT) compared with immunocompetent patients (COVID-19-immunocompetent) and LT recipients without COVID-19 symptoms (non-COVID-19-LT). RESULTS: Overall, 35 LT recipients were included in the COVID-19-LT cohort. 35 and 70 subjects fulfilling the matching criteria were assigned to the COVID-19-immunocompetent and non-COVID-19-LT cohorts, respectively. We showed that LT recipients, despite immunosuppression and less symptoms, mounted a detectable antinucleocapsid antibody titre in 80% of the cases, although significantly lower compared with the COVID-19-immunocompetent cohort (3.73 vs 7.36 index level, p<0.001). When analysing anti-S antibody response, no difference in positivity rate was found between the COVID-19-LT and COVID-19-immunocompetent cohorts (97.1% vs 100%, p=0.314). Functional antibody testing showed neutralising activity in 82.9% of LT recipients (vs 100% in COVID-19-immunocompetent cohort, p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the humoral response of LT recipients is only slightly lower than expected, compared with COVID-19 immunocompetent controls. Testing for anti-S antibodies alone can lead to an overestimation of the neutralising ability in LT recipients. Altogether, routine antibody testing against separate SARS-CoV-2 antigens and functional testing show that the far majority of LT patients are capable of mounting an adequate antibody response with neutralising ability."

One such complication is the formation of the left ventricular (LV) thrombus. There is a lack of clarity regarding the incidence, risk factors, and management of this complication. Aim: The aim of the study is to identify the clinical presentation, risk factors and outcome of COVID-19 patients with left ventricular thrombus (LVT). Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify all case reports of COVID-19 with LVT in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Results: Among the 65 patients identified, 60 had LVT, either at admission, or during the acute phase of the illness. Six patients with mild symptoms during the acute phase of viral illness had only the COVID-19 antibody test positivity at the time LV thrombus was detected. Few of the patients (23.1%) had no comorbidities. The mean age of the patients was 52.8 years, and the youngest patient was 4 years old. This suggests that LVT formation can occur in young COVID-19 patients with no co-morbid conditions. Most of the patients (69.2%) had more than one site of thrombosis. A mortality rate of 23.1% was observed in our review, and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was diagnosed in 33.3% of those who died. Conclusions: A high degree of suspicion for LVT must be maintained in patients with known cardiac disease and those with new-onset arterial or venous thromboembolism, and such patients may benefit from a screening echocardiography at admission. Relevance for Patients: The patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease must take added precautions to prevent acquiring COVID-19 infection as there is a higher risk of developing LV thrombus. In patients who develop LVT in COVID-19, mortality rate is higher."

The volume, negative content and potential for misinformation within COVID-19 related news can be an additional cause of distress. This systematic review aims to synthesise the research findings on the relationship between COVID-19 news and distress in young people. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases were searched on 24 April 2021 for articles that contained empirical research examining the association between COVID-19 news consumption and mental health in samples of young people with a mean age between 10-24 years. RESULTS: The 13 included studies involved 760,474 participants in predominantly cross-sectional studies, with data collected during COVID-19 lockdowns across seven countries. Increased consumption of COVID-19 news was associated with a decline in mental health (n =12). The results were more consistent for news obtained on social media with variation for traditional media sources. Misinformation may further explain the relationship. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity across study methodologies, lack of longitudinal research and validated measures of news consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed literature supports the association between increased consumption of COVID-19 related news and decreased mental health in young people. This group may benefit from support to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 news. Future research should utilise longitudinal designs, ecological momentary assessments, and reliable/valid measures of news consumption to explore the negative mental health associated with COVID-19 news in young people."

In this disease with a predisposition to thromboembolism, findings of nontraumatic focused hemorrhages are unexpected. As spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma is a serious condition with the absence of symptoms, creating a challenge for diagnosis, it should also be considered in COVID-19 which is thought to be predisposed to thromboembolism. Here, a 47-year-old woman with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis (diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and approved by nasopharyngeal swab test) is presented with spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma, and its management is reported. This case highlights the importance of considering both thromboembolic events and bleeding in cases with COVID-19 positivity. The balance between two sides of clotting mechanisms needs to be understood with novel research."
