1,Self-care behaviors of school-age children with heart disease.,"Purpose: This cross-sectional study was conducted to identify the level of self-care behaviors of school-age children with heart disease. Orem's self-care theory was used as the conceptual framework. Method: A purposive sampling method was used to select 82 (age 6-12 years old) school-age children with heart disease admitted at least once (within a year) and attending the outpatient department of three hospitals in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, China. The Medical Record Form, Demographic Form, and Self-care Behaviors of School-age Children with Heart Diseases Questionnaire (SBSCHDQ) were used to collect data. Results: Findings were: (1) The majority of the school-age children with heart disease had moderate levels of self-care behaviors. (2) The school-age children with heart disease whose heart functions are in Class I had a high level of self-care behaviors, and the school-age children whose heart functions are in Classes II and III had a moderate level of self-care behaviors. Moreover, the participants whose heart functions are in Class III had the lowest score of self-care behaviors. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide useful information for nurses to understand self-care behaviors of school-age children with heart disease. The findings also assist nurses to perform nursing interventions and provide proper discharge plans to this population."

5,Clinical cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive tool for the assessment of myocardial metabolism, without the use of radiation or intravenous contrast agents. Using the intrinsic magnetic resonance signals from nuclei, including (31)Phosphorus, (1)Hydrogen, (23)Sodium, and (13)Carbon and, more recently, hyperpolarization techniques, MRS provides a comprehensive metabolic assessment of cardiac muscle. This highly versatile technique has provided insights into the pathophysiology of cardiac metabolism in a wide range of conditions, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, genetic cardiomyopathies, heart transplantation, hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, and diabetes. In addition, MRS has value in the assessment of prognosis and for monitoring therapeutic strategies in heart failure. However, because of the low temporal and spatial resolution of the technique, MRS has so far been limited to research applications. With higher field strength magnets and novel hyperpolarization techniques, the promise of using MRS for clinical applications may eventually be fulfilled."
6,[Clinical features of thyrotoxic heart disease: analysis of 75 cases].,"Objective: To investigate the clinical features of thyrotoxic heart disease. Methods: The clinical data of 75 patients with thyrotoxic heart disease, 30 males and 45 females, aged 54.3 +/- 14.4 (17 approximately 84, with the course from 1 month to 30 years, were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Forty-seven of the 75 patients (63%)presented heart failure, 47 patients (63%) showed atrial fibrillation, 2 patients (3%) showed sick sinus syndrome; 48 patients (66%) showed left atrial enlargement, 31 (43%) showed left ventricular enlargement, 30 (41%) showed right atrial enlargement, 35 (47%) showed right ventricular enlargement, and 18 (25%) showed entire heart enlargement. Mitral valve regurgitation occurred in 45 patients, tricuspid regurgitation in 45, aortic valve regurgitation in 34, and pulmonary artery hypertension (with the pulmonary blood pressure of 44 +/- 7 mm Hg and LVEF of 60% +/- 19%) in 33 patients. Conclusion: The clinical manifestations of thyrotoxic heart disease are various Thyroid function should be investigated to exclude thyrotoxic heart disease when routine treatment is ineffective in heart disease. The key point of treatment is hyperthyroidism."
7,Cardiac evaluation of the newborn.,"The physical examination of the term newborn's cardiovascular system is reviewed detailing the normal and abnormal variants that can be found within the first few days after birth. The authors discuss the pathophysiologic changes that occur in the presence of congenital heart disease and how these changes affect the clinical presentation. The major common cardiac defects are described and discussed. Pulse oximetry screening is reviewed in detail indicating its value in the early detection of most cases of critical congenital heart disease. Finally, the reader is given several suggestions on diagnosis, stabilization, and when to refer to specialists."

9,Noncardiovascular findings associated with heart disease in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.,"Heart disease characterized by endomyocardial fibrosis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. From our series of 50 patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilia, we defined the noncardiovascular characteristics that distinguish patients at risk of developing endomyocardial fibrosis from those who remain free of heart disease. These groups did not differ with respect to the extent of eosinophilia or the duration of disease. Patients with clinically overt heart disease were more likely (p less than 0.05) to be male and HLA-Bw44 positive and have splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum levels of vitamin B12, and hypogranular or vacuolated eosinophils and abnormal early myeloid precursors in the peripheral blood. These idiopathic hypereosinophilic patients with heart disease were also more likely to have fibrosis and decreased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. In contrast, those who remained free of heart disease tended to be female and have angioedema, hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), and circulating immune complexes. Therefore, in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, male patients with a myeloproliferative type disorder and the HLA-Bw44 haplotype were at a much increased risk for the development of endomyocardial fibrosis. However, those patients with a hypersensitivity-like illness and angioedema who were female did not develop heart disease. Appreciation of this relative degree of risk for the major complication of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome should prove useful in the early identification and appropriate treatment of patients in whom endomyocardial fibrosis might develop."
