1,Underlying heart disease and microbiological spectrum of adult infective endocarditis in one Chinese university hospital: a 10-year retrospective study.,"Background and aim: To identify the underlying heart disease and microbiological pathogen associated with infective endocarditis (IE) in Chinese patients in one university hospital over a 10-year period. Methods: We recruited 115 adult patients admitted to Peking University First Hospital from 2002 to 2011 who were diagnosed with definite IE. Statistical analysis was performed to analyse data on demographics, clinical and laboratory findings, as well as microbiological pathogens. Results: The most common underlying heart diseases for IE were congenital heart disease (24.3%) followed by degenerative valvular disease (17.4%). Aortic (44.3%) and mitral (43.5%) valves were most frequently affected. The right-sided IE cases were all found in patients with congenital heart disease. The age of patients was younger in right-sided cases than that in left-sided ones (P = 0.001). There was no difference in the mortality among groups with different underlying heart disease (P = 0.841). Forty-four (38.3%) patients were infected with viridans group streptococci. The isolation rate of staphylococci in right-sided IE was higher than that in the left-sided IE group (P = 0.021). More than 85% of streptococci were susceptible to Î²-lactams. Conclusions: Congenital heart disease and degenerative valvular disease have overtaken rheumatic heart disease as the major underlying heart diseases associated with IE. Viridans group streptococci are the most common microbial cause of IE."
2,"Heart disease, family history and physical activity.","Objectives: This article examines the association of family history of heart disease and leisure-time physical activity with incident heart disease. Data source: The data are from the 1994/95, 1996/97 and 1998/99 longitudinal household components of Statistics Canada's National Population Health Survey. This study is based on information provided by 9,255 respondents aged 20 or older who reported that, in 1994/95, they were free of diagnosed heart disease and in good health. Analytical techniques: Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the association of family history and physical activity with a new diagnosis of heart disease, while controlling for age, sex, educational attainment, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index. Main results: When family history and other risk factors were taken into account, people who, in 1994/95, engaged in regular physical activity at a moderate level or beyond had lower odds of receiving a new diagnosis of heart disease than did sedentary individuals. People with a family history of heart disease who regularly participated in at least moderate physical activity had lower odds of developing heart disease than did their sedentary counterparts."

5,Strategies for heart disease in sub-Saharan Africa.,"The commonest forms of heart disease in sub-Saharan Africa are chronic rheumatic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, infectious forms of heart disease including chronic, constrictive and infective endocarditis, genetic forms of heart disease and arrhythmias. Malnutrition, with cardiac manifestations such as beriberi, and alcoholism also play a part. Ischaemic heart disease in sub-Saharan Africa at present affects mainly the small, Westernised white population. Heart disease is a less important cause of morbidity and mortality than many other infectious diseases but is likely to escalate in the next generation(s). The changing demographic picture dictates the way in which funds for research, prevention and treatment must be channelled to best advantage. A concerted effort must be made by cardiologists of African countries to arrest the advance of heart disease, and a declaration outlining these strategies has been endorsed by the Pan-African Society of Cardiology (PASCAR)."
6,Exercise: a risk for sudden death in patients with coronary heart disease.,"Although sudden arrhythmic death is usually unrelated to exertion, there is more than anecdotal evidence that strenuous exercise in patients with coronary heart disease carries an additional risk for sudden death. When cardiac arrest has been observed after exercise stress testing or within seconds after collapse associated with exertion, ventricular fibrillation has usually been present and has responded to the prompt application of a defibrillatory shock. Exertion-related cardiac arrest is typically a ""primary"" arrhythmic event not due to acute myocardial infarction. As estimated here, the additional risk of exercise for cardiac arrest may be more than 100-fold during or after a few minutes of vigorous exertion."

8,[Heart diseases in pregnant women].,"Background: diagnosis end treatment of heart diseases, physiopathologic changes in pregnancy. Aim: Pregnancy in woman with heart disease increases the risk of maternal and fetal complications. The aim of the study is to precise the physiopathologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic characteristics of heart diseases in pregnant woman. Methods: Extensive electronic search of the relevant literature was carried out using Medline. Key words used were:pregnancy, heart disease, maternal outcome, fetal outcome, cardiac complications. Results: Rheumatic heart disease represent the most common cardiopathy found in pregnant woman in our country. Regurgitant valvular diseases are often well tolerated with medical therapy. Severe aortic stenosis is associated with poor prognosis. The use of percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty has transformed treatment of mitral stenosis in symptomatic patients.In developed countries, congenital heart diseases are the most common cause of cardiopathy in pregnant women. Left-to-right shunts are generally well tolerated. Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome should be advised against pregnancy. Obstructive form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated frequently with hemodynamic deterioration in pregnancy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is usually considered as a contraindication of pregnancy. In the absence of underlying structural heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia are uncommon in pregnancy and usually don't require pharmacological treatment. Drug therapy of arrhythmia in pregnant woman is limited by side effects on the fetus. The prenatal counsel is based on the assessment of maternofetal risk. The management of pregnant woman requires a multidisciplinary team for optimal maternal and fetal outcomes."
9,Natural history of coronary heart disease and heart disease of uncertain etiology: Findings from a 50-year population study.,"Objectives: To describe the natural history of common heart disease incidence on a population study. Material and methods: A sample of 1712 men aged 40-59 was enrolled in 1960 and followed-up for 50years. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was categorized if manifested as sudden death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and other acute coronary syndromes, and as Heart Disease of Uncertain Etiology (HDUE) if manifested as heart failure, chronic arrhythmia, blocks, diagnoses of chronic CHD or hypertensive heart disease. Their characteristics and prognosis in terms of age at event, mortality and expectancy of life up to 50years were analyzed. Results: Incidence of first CHD and HDUE event or diagnosis was of 26.9 and 20.6%, respectively. First events were equally manifested as fatal or non-fatal occurrences among CHD, while non-fatal occurrences were almost always observed among HDUE. Cases of HDUE presented at a more advanced age and also average age at death was significantly more advanced than in CHD, respectively around 79 and 76years. Expectancy of life was significantly longer for HDUE (30.7years) than for CHD (27.6years). Strokes were more frequently ascertained among HDUE (14%) while 14% of death causes were due to cancer in both CHD and HDUE. Cancers were much higher (40%) among those never diagnosed CHD or HDUE who also had more stroke-due deaths (17%). Conclusion: This is the first investigation to report heart disease incidence and its natural history in a quasi-extinction cohort data from Italy in a pre-cardiac surgery era."
