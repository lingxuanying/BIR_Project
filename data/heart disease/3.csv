0,[Pregnancy and heart disease].,"Pregnancy and delivery are associated with substantial physiological changes that require adaptations in the cardiovascular system. These changes, well-tolerated in pregnant women without heart disease, expose woman with cardiovascular disease to serious risk. In fact, heart disease is the most frequent cause of maternal death, after psychiatric disorders, and the number of pregnant women with heart disease is expected to grow in the coming years. Preventing cardiovascular complications should be the main aim of every cardiologist involved in managing pregnant woman with congenital or acquired heart disease. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data which would help in the management of these patients during pregnancy and the clinical practice guidelines are often based on assumptions regarding how a specific substrate is going to respond to the physiological changes occurring due to pregnancy."
1,Cancer in heart disease patients: what are the limitations in the treatment strategy?,"Cardiovascular disease and cancer are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and can both be present in one patient. In patients with simultaneous disease, the most threatening disease should be treated first. This is usually heart disease, but this can pose specific problems. If percutaneous coronary intervention is preferred, bleeding and thrombotic tendencies have to be taken into account in the subsequent treatment of the malignancy. With coronary artery bypass grafting, the advantages and disadvantages of one- or two-stage procedures, and the use of extracorporeal circulation have to be balanced. Development of heart disease after treatment of malignancy could be due to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The effects of these cancer treatments have to be taken into account for the treatment options of the heart disease and the postoperative prognosis."
2,A systematic review of yoga for heart disease.,"Background: This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for yoga as an ancillary intervention for heart disease. Methods: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and IndMED were searched up to October 2013. Main outcome measures were mortality, nonfatal cardiac events, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors. Risk of bias, quality of evidence, and the strength of the recommendation for or against yoga were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and GRADE recommendations. Results: Seven RCTs with 624 patients comparing yoga to usual care were included. For coronary heart disease (four RCTs), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, for a reduced number of angina episodes, and for increased exercise capacity, and low evidence for reduced modifiable cardiac risk factors. For heart failure (two RCTs), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, and low evidence for increased exercise capacity, and for no effect on health-related quality of life. For cardiac dysrhythmias treated with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (one RCT), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, and for improved quality, and low evidence for effects on nonfatal device-treated ventricular events. Three RCTs reported safety data and reported that no adverse events occurred. Conclusions: Based on the results of this review, weak recommendations can be made for the ancillary use of yoga for patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cardiac dysrhythmia at this point."
3,Heart disease in women.,"Women face a disparity in the evaluation and treatment of coronary artery disease, even though coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States. Primary care physicians play an important role in the identification and treatment of risk factors and comorbidities. It is their obligation to ensure that women receive equal and appropriate care, and to advocate for their patients."
4,The impact of depression in heart disease.,"Depression and heart disease affect millions of people worldwide. Studies have shown that depression is a significant risk factor for new heart disease and that it increases morbidity and mortality in established heart disease. Many hypothesized and studied mechanisms have linked depression and heart disease, including serotonergic pathway and platelet dysfunction, inflammation, autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis imbalance, and psychosocial factors. Although the treatment of depression in cardiac patients has been shown to be safe and modestly efficacious, it has yet to translate into reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Understanding the impact and mechanisms behind the association of depression and heart disease may allow for the development of treatments aimed at altering the devastating consequences caused by these comorbid illnesses."
5,Sustained ventricular tachycardia in structural heart disease.,"Ventricular arrhythmias are responsible for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCD), particularly in patients with structural heart disease. Coronary artery disease, essentially previous myocardial infarction, is the most common heart disease upon which sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs, being reentry the predominant mechanism. Other cardiac conditions, such as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Chagas disease, sarcoidosis, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, and repaired congenital heart disease may also present with VT in follow-up. Analysis of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential for diagnosis. There are numerous electrocardiographic criteria that suggest VT with good specificity. The ECG also guides us in locating the site of origin of the arrhythmia and the presence of underlying heart disease. The electrophysiological study provides valuable information to establish the mechanism of the arrhythmia and guide the ablation procedure, as well as to confirm the diagnosis when dubious ECG. Given the poor efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, adjunctive catheter ablation contributes to reduce the frequency of VT episodes and the number of shocks in patients implanted with a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). ICD therapy has proven to be effective in patients with aborted SCD or sustained VT in the presence of structural heart disease. It is the only therapy that improves survival in this patient population and its implantation is unquestioned nowadays."
6,Proteomics of heart disease.,"Heart diseases resulting in heart failure are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The underlying molecular causes of cardiac dysfunction in most heart diseases are still largely unknown, but are likely to result from underlying alterations in gene and protein expression. Proteomics now allows us to examine global alterations in protein expression in the diseased heart and will provide new insights into cellular mechanisms involved in cardiac dysfunction and should also result in the generation of new diagnostic and therapeutic markers. In this article we review the current status of proteomic technologies and describe how these are being applied to studies of human heart disease."
7,"Heart transplantation in biventricular congenital heart disease: indications, techniques, and outcomes.","Heart transplantation is an accepted therapeutic modality for end-stage congenital heart disease for both biventricular and univentricular anomalies. Many transplant centers have pushed the limits of transplantation to include patients with high pulmonary vascular resistance, high panel reactive antibodies, positive cross-matches, and ABO-incompatibility. Excellent results have been possible, particularly with the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to prevent and treat rejection, infection, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Late graft failure and chronic rejection remain vexing problems. The vast majority of patients with biventricular congenital heart disease have undergone prior cardiac surgical procedures. Indications for transplantation in this subgroup are primarily progressive refractory heart failure following prior cardiac surgical reconstructive procedures. Contraindications to transplantation mimic those for other forms of end-stage heart disease. A determination of pulmonary vascular resistance is important in listing patients with biventricular congenital heart disease for heart transplantation. Modifications in the implant technique are necessary and vary depending on underlying recipient anatomy. Risk factors for perioperative outcomes in patients with biventricular congenital heart disease include the need for reoperation, the degree of anatomic reconstruction necessary during the implant procedure, and the degree of antibody sensitization, in addition to a number of other recipient and donor factors. Postoperative outcomes and survival are very good but remain inferior to those with cardiomyopathy in most series. In conclusion, patients with end-stage biventricular congenital heart disease represent a complex group of patients for heart transplantation, and require careful evaluation and management to ensure optimal outcomes."
8,Expression and function of microRNAs in heart disease.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful, recently recognized regulators of gene expression. miRNAs modulate virtually all aspects of cardiac biology, from cardiac specification and development to cardiomyocyte survival and hypertrophy. Expression profiling of experimental and human heart disease has shown that miRNA expression is altered in heart disease, and miRNA expression signatures may be useful biomarkers for heart disease diagnosis and prognosis. Mechanistic studies have revealed how miRNAs contribute to heart disease pathogenesis. Here we review the expression and function of miRNAs in heart disease."
9,Cardiac Rehabilitation for Women.,"Cardiac rehabilitation provides comprehensive secondary prevention services and improves outcomes among patients with coronary heart disease, systolic heart failure, and other cardiac rehabilitation indications. Worldwide, cardiac rehabilitation services are underutilized. Underutilization is more common among women than in men. This chapter reviews barriers to referral, enrollment, and adherence among women and potential interventions to improve women's participation in cardiac rehabilitation. Gender similarities and differences in clinical, behavioral, and health outcomes of cardiac rehabilitation are addressed, and gaps in the evidence base are discussed, pointing to areas of future research."
