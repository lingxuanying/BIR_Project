0,Embryology of the heart and its impact on understanding fetal and neonatal heart disease.,"Heart development is a complex process during which the heart needs to transform from a single tube towards a fully septated heart with four chambers and a separated outflow tract. Several major events contribute to this process, that largely overlap in time. Abnormal heart development results in congenital heart disease, which has an estimated incidence of 1% of liveborn children. Eighty percent of cases of congenital heart disease are considered to have a multifactoral developmental background, whereas knowledge of monogenetic causes for congenital heart disease is still limited. This review focuses on several novel findings in cardiac development that might enhance our knowledge of aetiology and support refinement of prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease."
1,"Heart disease mortality in women: racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities.","Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women. The recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) landmark document, Women and Heart Disease: An Atlas of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mortality, identifies the relationship between geography, race, ethnicity, gender, and the determinants of mortality. Overwhelming evidence supports that African American women, especially those residing in the South, experience higher heart disease death rates than women of other ethnic, racial, and geographic origins. This publication presents a unique opportunity for health care providers to use derived county-specific data in education, research, and provision of health promotion and disease prevention services to all women."
2,Diabetic heart disease.,"The fact that a significant proportion of diabetics die of heart disease has led to the belief that the excess mortality is due to coronary athersclerosis, yet many risk factors for the latter are common to diabetics and non-diabetics. In fact, heart disease in diabetes is not synonymous with coronary heart disease. There is evidence that heart disease in diabetes includes a variable combination of coronary atheroma, cardiomyopathy, micro-angiopathy and autonomioc neuropathy."
3,Heart disease in diabetes mellitus.,"The spectrum of heart disease in diabetic patients is broad and complex. This article discusses the epidemiologic associations between the two causes. It attempts to summarize the effects of diabetes at the cellular, vascular, and myocardial levels. The clinical manifestations are explored, and the treatment of heart disease as it pertains to diabetic patients is discussed."

5,The natriuretic peptides as biomarkers for adults with congenital heart disease.,"Thanks to improved treatment of congenital heart disease early in life, many such patients reach adulthood. Adults with congenital heart disease are an increasing population, which will continue to grow in the future. The clinical state of these patients is affected by their complex heart diseases, as well as the consequence of past corrective or palliative interventions. The natriuretic peptides are important markers for the presence, severity and prognosis of heart disease. The majority of the current knowledge is on patients with acquired heart disease. This article reviews the present knowledge regarding the role of the natriuretic peptides in adults with various forms of congenital heart disease."

8,Long-term cardio-respiratory consequences of heart disease in childhood.,"The dynamic interaction between the heart and lungs leads to a degree of respiratory co-morbidity including both restrictive and obstructive airway abnormalities, which may be overlooked in children with congenital and acquired heart disease. The improving imaging techniques of the heart, both foetal and post-natal coupled with minimally invasive techniques for device implantation and better operative techniques for complex congenital heart disease have resulted in more children with longitudinally documented structural heart disease surviving into their adult years. Children presenting with cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias, as well as those with repaired cardiac disease, can be offered advice with regard to formal exercise testing and participation in sports, which may be particularly helpful in the adolescent years. Furthermore, through the interest of some adult cardiologists in paediatric heart disease over the past 20 years, facilities for the smooth transition of care to adult services are improving."
9,Pregnancy and heart disease: a review.,"About one per cent of all pregnancies are affected by maternal heart disease, which may have significant influence on the maternal and foetal outcome. In this context rheumatic heart disease is declining and congenital heart disease is becoming the dominant category. Our experience of pregnancy in the new groups of patients created by paediatric heart surgery is scant and a continuous update is required."
