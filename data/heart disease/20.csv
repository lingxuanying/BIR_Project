0,[Congenital cardiopathies in adults].,"In the last 30 years, major advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease in children. As a result, many children survive to adulthood, some of them with sequelae. In adults, the most common congenital heart disease is atrial septal defect. The most common causes of cyanotic congenital heart disease are the tetralogy of Fallot and Eisenmenger's syndrome. In this review we discuss the more common acyanotic and cyanotic congenital heart diseases that physicians who care for adults are likely to encounter."

4,The electrocardiogram in the highly trained athlete.,Athletes may have congenital or acquired structural heart disease revealed by abnormal electrocardiogram. They may have structural heart disease despite a normal electrocardiogram. Athletes with normal hearts may show electrocardiogram changes that mimic those of heart disease. The distinction between adaptive hypertrophy and pathologic hypertrophy may be difficult based solely on the electrocardiogram.

7,Clinical analysis of hyperthyroid heart disease in 31 elderly patients.,"A clinical analysis of hyperthyroidism heart diseases was conducted in 31 elderly patients, of whom 15 (48.4%) had been misdiagnosed before accurate diagnoses were reached 4 months to 3 years later. Among the 15 misdiagnosed cases, 9 were misdiagnosed as coronary heart disease, 3 as pulmonary heart disease, 2 as hypertension heart disease and 1 as dilated cardiomyopathy. This result suggests that physicians need to be more aware of elderly hyperthyroidism, and thorough history inquiry, systemic examination and timely thyroid function test can reduce the misdiagnosis of hyperthyroid heart disease in elderly patients."

9,Sudden cardiac death in childhood.,"To evaluate the mechanism of sudden death in childhood and the physical activity levels at the onset of sudden death, we studied the following items: (1) the incidence and the circumstances surrounding sudden death at school in Kanagawa Prefecture, (2) high risk heart diseases detected among healthy school children by heart disease screening, (3) sudden cardiac death or near miss seen in outpatients with heart disease except congenital heart disease. Among total 15,156,346 school children, sudden death was observed in 97 subjects (M:77, F:20). Annual incidence of sudden death was 6.4 per 10(6). Of the 97 subjects, acute heart failure of unknown etiology was found in 60 (62%), cardiovascular disease in 18 (19%), cerebral vascular accidents in 14 (14%) and heat stroke in 5 (5%). Of the 78 subjects (M:64, F:14) considered as sudden cardiac death, 62 (79%) died during sports activities, and 16 (21%) died at rest. Of the 62 subjects, 29 died during track and field activities and 7 while swimming, both in physical education classes. Eighteen died during athletic club activities and 8 during extracurricular activities. Consequently, 54 subjects (87%) died in the presence of a school teacher. Of the 18 subjects with cardiovascular disease, 9 (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 3, myocarditis in 3, Kawasaki disease in 2 and long QT in one) were diagnosed initially by the autopsy study. Latent high risk heart diseases, detected among presumably healthy school children by the heart disease screening program, were the following: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Kawasaki disease and some arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, sick sinus syndrome, A-V block and atrial fibrillation). Follow-up observations of outpatients with heart disease revealed the same results as the heart disease screening program. In order to prevent sudden death at school, the following recommendations should be observed: 1) sports directors should learn ""sports medicine in childhood"", including primary cardiovascular resuscitation, 2) an accurate heart disease screening program should be operated to detect latent high risk heart diseases, advise on adequate medical treatment, and help ensure an appropriate selection of sports activities, 3) comprehensive autopsy studies should be performed."
