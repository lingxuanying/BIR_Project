0,Proteomics: unraveling the complexity of heart disease and striving to change cardiology.,"Heart disease encompasses a broad spectrum of pathological conditions, involving many different etiologies. Abnormal changes to the proteome, the complete cellular protein complement, are responsible for the various disease phenotypes. The proteome is dynamic, however, and is constantly changing due to a combination of factors, including temporal and functional regulation of gene expression, differrential mRNA splicing and subsequent protein post-translational modifications. This dynamic response is compounded during the development of acute responses of the heart (such as myocardial preconditioning, stunning and infarction), just as it is during the development and onset of chronic heart disease (eg, heart failure). Proteomic analyses enable the identification and characterization of these disease-induced protein changes using a multitude of experimental techniques. This review provides an overview of proteomic technology with emphasis on the unique problems associated with the analysis of the heart, summarizes the latest proteomic studies, assesses what information analogous genomic studies can provide for the design and execution of proteomics, and finally discusses the implications of proteomics for the identification and development of diagnostics and therapeutic targets specifically for heart disease. The future holds great promise for the availability of a panel of cardiac serum biomarkers able to delineate different stages of each heart disease, thus allowing the design of clinical interventions potentially using stage-specific therapeutics. All of this is feasible only with detailed information about the unique and selective protein modifications that occur during the development of heart disease."
1,Alcoholic heart disease.,"Alcohol has been suspected for many years of being a cause of heart disease. For a while its role was obscured by its association with beriberi heart disease and, more recently, by the toxic effect of cobalt in beer. Experimental studies, however, have provided convincing evidence of the primary role of alcohol itself. The mode of action is still in dispute. In the absence of specific findings, the diagnosis is made chiefly by exclusion of other known causes of heart disease and by a history of excessive alcohol intake over a number of years. The usual methods of treatment for the manifestations of heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic phenomena are important, but total abstinence from alcohol is the single essential factor. The sooner this is instituted, the better is the chance of interrupting the otherwise inexorable course to death."
2,Advances in acquired pediatric heart disease.,"Acquired heart disease in children may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Advances continue to be made in understanding Kawasaki disease, acute and chronic rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. The role of superantigens, particularly bacterial toxins, in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease continues to be defined. Intravascular ultrasound promises to improve the assessment of coronary arteries in Kawasaki disease. Current recommendations for the long-term management of Kawasaki disease are discussed. Significant changes in the epidemiology of acute rheumatic fever and endocarditis are noted. Updates on the role of echocardiography as well as current therapeutic issues in these diseases are addressed. The application of immunologic and molecular biologic techniques have implicated genetic and immune factors in the pathogenesis of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. The relationship between viral infection and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as the role of autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these disorders, remains controversial."
3,"Heart disease in patients with stroke: incidence, impact, and implications for rehabilitation. Part 1: Classification and prevalence.","Heart disease is found in about 75% of patients who have suffered a stroke. Cardiovascular diseases can be risk factors, etiologic mechanisms, associated conditions, or direct consequences of stroke. Cardiac comorbidity may delay initiation of rehabilitation, complicate the course and care of the patient with stroke, inhibit participation in a therapeutic exercise program, limit functional outcomes, and contribute to early mortality in the individual with cerebrovascular disease. Part 1 of this two-part article describes the various forms of heart disease that may be seen in stroke patients, and reviews the incidence figures for each type of associated cardiac condition."

5,[Neurological complications in patients with heart disease].,"Introduction: The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients from blood. This fact explains its tight dependence on the cardiovascular system as well as the after effects of heart disease on the central nervous system. Objectives: This study intends to describe the main conditions in which a neurological disorder appears secondarily to or coincidentally with heart disease. Methods. A bibliographical review of publications of neurological disorders related to heart disease is carried out. Results: The main cardiac diseases that can induce neurological disorders include: disturbances of the cardiac rhythm, congenital heart diseases, and complications of cardiac catheterisation and reparative surgery. Likewise, other conditions congenital or acquired in which neurological and heart disorders coexist must be considered. Conclusions: Medical practice confirms that heart diseases account for different neurological conditions that can manifest by a very variable clinical expressivity."
6,Peer support intervention trials for individuals with heart disease: a systematic review.,"Background: Heart disease is a major cause of illness, disability and death worldwide with high personal, community and healthcare costs. Social support affects psychological and physical morbidity, mortality, and adjustment to chronic disease. Peer support, a specific type of social support, has been shown to be an effective intervention for a variety of populations. Aim: The aim of this paper is to critically examine the effects of peer support interventions on health outcomes in individuals with heart disease. Methods: Searches were made of ACP Journal Club, EBM, CDSR, DARE, CCTR (1982-2005), MEDLINE (1966-2005), PsycINFO (1975-July 2005), HealthSTAR (1975-June 2005), and CINAHL (1982-July 2005) using text words and MeSH headings. Results: Electronic and hand searching yielded 27 studies and reviews. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using guidelines from The Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group and The Cochrane Collaboration. Inferences about the results were limited to critical appraisal. The trials demonstrated some positive effects of peer support for individuals with heart disease, including higher levels of self-efficacy, improved activity, reduced pain, and fewer emergency room visits. Conclusion: Despite some evidence supporting peer support for individuals with heart disease, methodological problems preclude generalizations. Further research with greater methodological rigor is warranted."
7,Acquired heart disease in children is not necessarily rheumatic.,"Acquired heart diseases (AHD) cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. There are limited studies on their burden in children. We conducted a retrospective study of 85 consecutive children diagnosed with AHD using clinical evaluation and echocardiography at Medical College, Kanpur, India to determine the aetiology and outcome of AHD in children. We found rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in one-third, cardiomyopathies or myocarditis combined in a further third and the remaining third were other causes, including pericardial diseases and metabolic or genetic disorders. These latter diseases were frequently misdiagnosed, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Hence, in children of all age groups presenting with unexplained shock, dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and ascites, cardiac status should be carefully and critically evaluated so that non-rheumatic AHD may not be missed."
8,Coronary heart disease in women: a 'new' problem.,"Recent reports of ""sex bias"" in the management of heart disease serves to focus on a more fundamental problem. Too little is known about the biology of heart disease in women or the reasons for striking differences in women's risks, prognosis, and treatment outcome--medical or surgical. Studies more sharply focused on these issues could improve treatment for half of the patient population."
