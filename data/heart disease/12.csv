0,The clinical and diagnostic significance of anti-myosin autoantibodies in cardiac disease.,"Autoimmunity is influenced by genetic, immune, hormonal, and environmental factors. Viral infections may trigger autoimmunity. It has been established that autoimmunity may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of heart disease. Anti-heart autoantibodies have been identified in the sera of patients with heart diseases, as well as in low titers in certain healthy individuals. Nevertheless, the role of humoral immunity in the development of autoimmune heart disease has not been fully established. Anti-myosin autoantibodies appear in several heart diseases such as myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, Chagas' heart disease, Kawasaki disease, rheumatic fever, and ischemic myocardium. The pathogenic role of anti-myosin autoantibodies in heart disease is not fully understood. Moreover, little is known concerning the clinical implications of anti-myosin autoantibodies in heart disease and its prognostic significance. Anti-cardiac myosin autoantibodies were found to cross-react with the β-adrenergic receptor. Studies have reported the effective use of the anti-myosin directed immune-modulating approach in animals with heart disease, although no specific anti-myosin autoantibody therapeutic approach has been attempted in humans. Herein, we review the current knowledge of anti-myosin autoantibodies and the use of targeted immune-modulating therapy in different heart diseases."
1,Announcement: American Heart Month - February 2017.,"Each February, the observance of American Heart Month helps raise awareness of ways to stay heart healthy and prevent heart disease. For 30 years, the number of deaths from heart disease, the number one killer of persons in the United States, declined. However, that progress has stalled in recent years, potentially because of high rates of obesity and hypertension, important risk factors for heart disease (1). With increased awareness and education, everyone can work together to prevent the conditions that lead to heart disease."

3,Reducing the Prevalence and Costs of Heart Disease.,"(1) Approximately one in four women and one in five men will die within the first year of having a heart attack. (2) About $108 billion is spent to treat coronary heart disease each year. (3) Engaging in health behaviors—such as keeping blood pressure, cholesterol and weight low—reduces risk of heart attack or stroke by more than 80 percent."

7,Management of pregnancy in women with acquired and congenital heart disease.,"Heart disease is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the UK. Deaths from acquired conditions such as ischaemic heart disease are increasing and often occur in patients with no history of heart disease, thus emphasising the need for vigilance for risk factors in women of childbearing age. All women with known heart disease should have pre-pregnancy counselling to assess for maternal and fetal risk. Women deemed to be at moderate or high risk should be under the care of a specialist antenatal team with experience of managing women with heart disease in pregnancy. Conditions that are considered particularly high risk (mortality >10%) include Marfan syndrome with dilated aortic root, severe left heart obstructive lesions, pulmonary hypertension, and severe left ventricular dysfunction. This article reviews the management of women with heart disease during pregnancy, labour and in the puerperium."
8,Interventional treatment of congenital heart disease patients.,"During the last 10 years the interventional treatment of congenital and structural heart diseases has known enormous changes in techniques, methods and patients management. Lesions previously treated surgically are now approached in the catheterization laboratory. The advent of multidisciplinary approach of congenital heart disease has made possible the development of hybrid techniques, of fetal medicine and of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- guided cardiac catheterization. Technological innovation has introduced new concepts in treatment of congenital heart disease patients and has allowed to adapt different techniques to single patients. The knowledge of the evolution of structural heart disease has allowed to chose the best percutaneous and/ or surgical technique and the best materials to optimize long term results. Improvement in non invasive imaging modality has allowed to diminish the radiation exposure and to provide useful information to interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons. Absorbable, drug eluting tools will change the treatment and probably the natural history of congenital and structural cardiac and vascular diseases."
9,Developmental origins of myocardial abnormalities in postnatal life 1.,"Poor quality and quantity maternal nutrition during pregnancy exerts permanent and damaging effects on the heart of the developing fetus. The developmental origin of adult heart disease is considered an important and critical factor in the pathogenesis of myocardial abnormalities in later life. Low birth mass, a marker of intrauterine stress, has been linked to a predisposition to heart disease. In this article, our work on the impact of exposure to a low-protein diet, in utero, on the developing heart and its long-term consequences are discussed. Other studies providing some supportive evidence are also described. It is proposed that normal fetal nutrition, growth, and development through efficient maternal nutrition (as well as other predisposing factors) before and during pregnancy may serve as a strategy for the primary prevention of heart disease."
