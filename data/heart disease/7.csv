0,Evaluation of congenital heart disease by magnetic resonance imaging.,"Magnetic resonance imaging has proven to be useful in the assessment of patients with complex congenital heart disease and in the post-surgical follow-up of patients with corrected congenital heart disease. A thorough understanding of the congenital cardiac malformations that can be encountered is needed and the use of the sequential segmental analysis helps to standardize the evaluation and diagnosis of (complex) congenital heart disease. After surgical correction of congenital heart defects, patients must be followed over extended periods of time, because morphological and functional abnormalities may still be present or may develop. The use of echocardiography may be hampered in these patients as scar tissue and thorax deformities limit the acoustic window. Magnetic resonance imaging has proven to be advantageous in the follow-up of these post-surgical patients and with the use of several different techniques the morphological as well as functional abnormalities can be evaluated and followed over time."

3,Nutritional therapy in the treatment of heart disease in dogs.,"A number of diseases affecting the heart are prevalent in canines. Acquired diseases, those which develop over the course of an animal's lifetime (rather than congenital defects present at birth), have recently been the subject of several studies to determine the efficacy of dietary supplementation on symptom presentation, disease severity, and mortality rates. Specifically, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol), L-carnitine, taurine, and fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) have all been evaluated in the prevention and treatment of many types of heart disease in dogs. Other supplements with preliminary evidence, meriting further investigation, include magnesium, Crataegus, and the B vitamins. Both clinical observation and interventional trials with various breeds have provided clear evidence for the benefit of numerous supplements on canine heart disease. Appropriate levels of certain dietary nutrients have been shown to increase life span, improve life quality, reduce symptoms and physical evidence of disease, and decrease mortality rates in these animals."

8,Echocardiography in adults with congenital heart disease.,"Echocardiography is a valuable tool in the investigation and follow-up of adult patients with congenital heart disease. The majority of these patients have been recognised and treated in childhood, and effective investigations in adult life depend on exact knowledge of the patient history and previous treatments/operations. The major lesions are presented and important echocardiographic features briefly discussed."
