0,Heart disease among children with HIV/AIDS attending the paediatric infectious disease clinic at Mulago Hospital.,"Background: There are very few published studies of heart disease in HIV infected children living in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with more than 50% of the world's population of HIV infected patients. Objectives: To determine the prevalence, and describe the type and clinical presentation of heart disease among children with HIV attending an ambulatory clinic. Methodology: Two hundred and thirty (230) HIV infected children attending the Paediatric Infectious Disease Clinic at Mulago hospital were recruited by simple random sampling in a cross-sectional study. The children were evaluated clinically, and investigated by electrocardiography and echocardiography. Results: Thirty-two children (13.9%) had asymptomatic HIV disease, 156 (67.8%) had AIDS related complex while 42 (18.3%) had AIDS. Heart abnormalities were detected in 51% of the children (40.0% by echocardiography alone and 26.5% by electrocardiography alone). Heart abnormalities were most prevalent in children with AIDS (76.2%) and least prevalent in children with asymptomatic HIV disease (25.0%). The abnormalities included; Sinus tachycardia (21%), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (17%), right ventricular dilatation (14%), congenital heart disease (4.8%), dilated cardiomyopathy (3.0%), pericarditis (2.2%) and cor pulmonale (1.3%). Children with left ventricular systolic dysfunction significantly had easy fatigability, dyspnoea on exertion and tachypnoea. Other heart abnormalities presented with non-specific clinical features. Conclusion: Heart abnormalities were common especially in children with symptomatic HIV disease and included sinus tachycardia, left ventricular systolic dysfunction and right ventricular dilatation. The detected heart abnormalities, except left ventricular systolic dysfunction, had non-specific clinical features."
1,Conquering heart disease: a call to action.,"Despite 20th century scientific and technologic advances in the area of cardiovascular medicine and public health and associated benefits in terms of significant declines in mortality, heart disease remains as the dominant cause of death for all Americans. Tremendous geographic variation in age-adjusted coronary heart disease mortality, varying over two-fold between the highest and lowest states, provides troubling evidence that this epidemic is raging unrelentingly in many communities across our country. Also disturbing are signs that the significant decline in coronary heart disease mortality observed since the 1960s may have slowed in recent years. The coronary heart disease epidemic continues to hit hard among certain racial and ethnic minorities, prompting the Healthy People 2010 national call for action to eliminate cardiovascular disease disparity."
2,Geriatric heart diseases in dogs.,"A discussion of the diagnosis and therapy of heart disease in an aged pet does not differ significantly from that in a pet of any age. Mitral regurgitation constitutes by far the most important geriatric heart disease, and the selection of drugs to treat heart disease of aging pets is based on identification of specific pathologic features (eg, atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement) for which each aspect of treatment (eg, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, spironolactone) is specific."

4,Problems in veterinary ultrasonographic analysis of acquired heart disease.,"Echocardiography in veterinary medicine has both enhanced our ability to diagnose and treat cardiac diseases in small animals and added confusion to what we already know. Because we can actually see the heart beating and visualize blood flows within the cardiac chambers as well as measure velocities of blood flows, we have a tool that increases our non-invasive diagnostic abilities. On the other hand, the lines between different heart diseases are not always clear-cut, and the more we learn about heart disease the more we see the shades of distinction between different diseases become blurred. This chapter will look at the main abnormalities we see in veterinary medicine (mitral regurgitation, pericardial disease, and the different feline and canine cardiomyopathies) and will attempt to help the veterinary echocardiographer avoid common problems encountered in acquired heart disease as well as use echocardiographic information to gain a better understanding of the disease process occurring in animals."

6,Cardiac support in burned patients with heart disease.,"The author describes the hemodynamic changes typical of burn shock and burn disease and emphasises the typical features of the phases of burn shock (""ebb"", ""flow""). The author also stresses that the myocardial insufficiency of the burned patients is due to the changes of preload-afterload, disturbances of the myocardial compliance and desynchronisation of the left-right ventricular function. If the injured were pretraumatically heart patients (COCM, ischemic heart disease) fluid replacement in these cases is an appropriate heart therapy. The choice of further treatment is based upon normalization of PVR, TPR ""compliance"" and oxygenization of myocardium. In the ""ebb"" phase of shock vasodilators and Ca-entry blockers, in the ""flow"" phase beta-adrenergic blockers are suggested. In every severe case due to ischemia induced by metabolic and hemodynamic changes, NG (and derivatives) treatment is justified. The author considers the application of positive inotropic agents in all the cases as unreasonable and proves their necessity (Dobutrex, Digoxin) only after objective determination of decreased contractility."

9,Congenital heart disease in boxer dogs: results of 6 years of breed screening.,"The aim of this study was to analyse the results of 6years (1999-2004) of mandatory breed screening for congenital heart disease in Boxer dogs using physical examination and echocardiography. Records of 1283 Boxers were reviewed and 165 dogs (12.86%) were found to be affected by heart disease, with aortic and pulmonic stenosis being the most frequent cardiac lesions. Comparison of these results with those of a previous survey showed a lower overall prevalence of both outflow obstructions, particularly of the more severe forms. A male predisposition for both aortic and pulmonic stenosis was evident from the study. Consistent with reports from other countries, soft left basilar heart murmurs were detected in both healthy dogs and dogs affected with congenital heart disease."
