0,Radiographic evaluation of caudal vena cava size as a useful parameter for the diagnosis of heart disease in dairy cattle.,"To quantify the radiographic parameters of the caudal vena cava (CVC) in healthy cattle and demonstrate their clinical usefulness, the present study compared the ratios of the diameter of the thoracic CVC to the diameter of the aorta (Ao) and length of the thoracic vertebrae (VL), which are all positioned in the same intercostal space, in 81 healthy control cattle (43 growing, 38 adult) and 10 cattle with heart disease. The average diameter of the CVC (CVCave) was correlated with the size of the Ao and VL in the control cows. Although the diameter and pulsation index of the CVC differed significantly between the growing and adult cows, the ratios of CVC/Ao and CVC/VL were fixed values for both the growing and mature cattle. However, in the cattle with heart disease, the pulsation index of the CVC was significantly lower or there was absence of pulsation due to a dilated CVC, and the ratio of CVCave/Ao and CVCave/VL were significantly higher than those in the healthy cattle."
1,[Update on geriatric cardiology].,"This article contains a review of the main developments in the field of geriatric cardiology reported during 2007, and discusses recent consensus statements. The article focuses on work dealing with the specific characteristics of elderly patients with ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease."
2,"The impact of income on the echocardiographic pattern of heart diseases in Kano, Nigeria.","Background: The aims of the present study were to assess the echocardiographic pattern of heart diseases, and to compare the pattern seen in a private echocardiography centre patronized by high income earners (group 1), with that in Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital patronized by low income earners (group 2), in Kano, Nigeria. Methods: the study was retrospective in design. The records of patients aged > or =15 years for a one year period (July 2006-June 2007) were reviewed. Results: Hypertensive heart disease (in 56.7%) was the most common heart disease, more common among group 1 patients (p=0.027). Dilated cardiomyopathy was the 2nd most common heart disease (in 15.2%), more common among group 2 patients (p=0.037). Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) was the 3rd most common (in 8.7%) heart disease in the study, more common than rheumatic heart disease (in 8.3%). Peripartum cardiomyopathy was exclusively found among group 2 patients (4.3%). Conclusion: The pattern of heart diseases in Kano differs between low and higher income earners. HHD was the commonest heart disease among both low income and higher income earners. The relatively high frequency of IHD might be a demonstration of the advanced stage of epidemiologic transition in Kano Nigeria."

4,Consequences of the prolonged waiting time for patient candidates for heart surgery.,"Objective: To assess mortality and the psychological repercussions of the prolonged waiting time for candidates for heart surgery. Methods: From July 1999 to May 2000, using a standardized questionnaire, we carried out standardized interviews and semi-structured psychological interviews with 484 patients with coronary heart disease, 121 patients with valvular heart diseases, and 100 patients with congenital heart diseases. Results: The coefficients of mortality (deaths per 100 patients/year) were as follows: patients with coronary heart disease, 5.6; patients with valvular heart diseases, 12.8; and patients with congenital heart diseases, 3.1 (p<0.0001). The survival curve was lower in patients with valvular heart diseases than in patients with coronary heart disease and congenital heart diseases (p<0.001). The accumulated probability of not undergoing surgery was higher in patients with valvular heart diseases than in the other patients (p<0.001), and, among the patients with valvular heart diseases, this probability was higher in females than in males (p<0.01). Several patients experienced intense anxiety and attributed their adaptive problems in the scope of love, professional, and social lives, to not undergoing surgery. Conclusion: Mortality was high, and even higher among the patients with valvular heart diseases, with negative psychological and social repercussions."
