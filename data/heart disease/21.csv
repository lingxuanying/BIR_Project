0,Changing pattern of heart diseases in Shanghai from the 1950s to 1980s.,"Objective: To determine the pattern of dynamic change in types of heart diseases in the past 4 decades for providing a reference to treatment and prevention of heart diseases in China. Methods: All adult cardiac patients admitted to the Zhong Shan Hospital and Hua Shan Hospital from 1948 to 1989 were analyzed. The constituent ratio of different heart diseases in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was compared. Results: The percentage of heart diseases among medical inpatients increased in each of the recent 4 decades, from 9.89%, 15.69%, 20.90% to 23.54% respectively. The constituent ratio of different heart diseases changed, coronary heart disease constituted the highest proportion, next came rheumatic heart disease, and congenital heart disease was in third place. Congenital heart disease, myocarditis, cardiac dysrhythmia without organic heart disease, cardiomyopathy and endocarditis increased, rheumatic heart disease, pulmonary heart disease and hypertensive heart disease apparently decreased; syphilitic heart disease could rarely be encountered. Conclusion: China is now facing a low overall death rate, a long life expectancy and an aging population. The incidence of heart diseases increased gradually and patterns of heart diseases kept changing. The overall trend is that heart diseases which were not related to infection are increasing while heart diseases related to bacterial infection are decreasing."
1,Advances in interventional cardiology: beyond the balloon.,"The world of interventional cardiology has changed dramatically since the advent of balloon angioplasty. New therapies have evolved over the past decade as knowledge of the pathophysiology of heart disease has increased. Nurses who have an understanding of this pathophysiology will be better equipped to manage and educate their patients, teaching them about current and future interventional therapies. This article reviews the pathophysiology of heart disease, current interventional therapies, and the future directions for interventional cardiology nursing practice."
2,Cardiac disease in pregnancy.,"The pregnant patient with normal cardiac function can accommodate many significant alterations in the cardiovascular system without difficulty. Pregnancy in a patient with significant cardiac disease, however, can be extremely hazardous, resulting in decompensation and even death. these conditions account for up to 30% of maternal mortality. This article reviews the interaction between cardiac disease and pregnancy."
3,"Clinical significance of blood brain natriuretic peptide level measurement in the detection of heart disease in untreated outpatients: comparison of electrocardiography, chest radiography and echocardiography.","The aim of present study was to compare the predictive characteristics and cost-benefit of measuring the concentration of blood brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), compared with electrocardiography (ECG), chest radiography and echocardiography, as a diagnostic test for heart disease. The study group comprised 130 untreated patients who had symptoms suggestive of heart disease. According to the results of additional examinations and follow-up checks, 86 patients were diagnosed as having heart disease and 44 patients were judged free of heart disease. Positive findings in each test suggestive of heart disease were checked in accordance with criteria, and the number of positive and negative cases for each test was calculated. The predictive characteristics, such as specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, of each test and the cost-benefit value were calculated and analyzed statistically. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of blood BNP and echocardiography were significantly greater than those of ECG and chest radiography. Echocardiography had a significantly lower cost-benefit value compared with measuring blood BNP concentration. Thus, the blood BNP concentration had significantly higher predictive characteristics than ECG and chest radiography, and a cost-benefit value significantly greater than that of echocardiography."

Objective To study the pattern and the prevalence of cardiac diseases, its age wise distribution and to determine their risk factors for mortality in children presented to Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. Method A study of cardiac diseases in children, since birth to 16 years of age attending the department of pediatrics in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital was done over a period of 30 months (Jan 2014 to June 2016). The pattern of disease was studied. Detailed clinical examination of all cases was done followed by the necessary relevant investigations including electrocardiography, chest x-ray, echocardiography and supportive laboratory investigations. Result In this study period, 218 pediatric cardiac cases were encountered, among which 144 cases (66.05%) were Congenital Heart Disease, 57 cases (26.14%) were Rheumatic Heart Disease, 14 cases (6.42%) were Pericardial Disease and 3 cases (1.37%) were classified as Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Majority of Congenital Heart Disease were of isolated Ventricular Septal Defect (25%) and isolated Atrial Septal Defect (20.13%) followed by Patent Ductus Arteriosus (9.02%), Tetralogy of Fallot (6.94%) and Complex Congenital Heart Disease (6.25%). All of the Rheumatic Heart Disease primarily involved the Mitral Valve; however combined Aortic Valve involvement was seen in 26.31% of cases. All the 14 cases of pericardial disease presented with pericardial effusion and two cases presented with constrictive pericarditis. All the cases of pericardial disease were investigated to be of tubercular in origin. Conclusion Septal defects are the most common Congenital Heart Disease encountered in children. Although the prevalence of Rheumatic Heart Disease is decreasing worldwide, it is still a big burden in our community. Tubercular pericardial effusion is still not uncommon and should be suspected with a child presenting with pericardial effusion. Increased level of cardiac care and corrective surgeries are needed for children with cardiac disease in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital."
