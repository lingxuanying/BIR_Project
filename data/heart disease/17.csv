6,Clinical and echocardiographic evaluation of neonates with heart murmurs.,"In this study, 116 neonates (58M, 58F), aged 12h to 14d, with heart murmurs were examined by echocardiography: 26 were preterm and 90 full-term neonates. The clinical diagnosis was classified into definite heart disease, possible heart disease and innocent murmur. The final diagnosis was based on echocardiography and, in some cases, cardiac catheterization or surgery. The results showed that 97 (84%) neonates had heart diseases; 19 (16%) had a normal heart, including 7 with tricuspid regurgitation and 9 with physiological peripheral pulmonic stenosis. Out of 88 neonates with clinically definite heart disease, the final diagnosis was changed to normal heart in 9 (10%) cases and the lesion-specific diagnosis was changed in 9 (10%) neonates. In four cases, the clinical diagnosis of ventricular septal defect or pulmonary stenosis was changed to double-outlet right ventricle, single ventricle, hypoplastic left heart syndrome or tetralogy of Fallot. The clinical diagnosis was correct in 77-85% for varying simple lesions. In 5 of 21 neonates with clinically possible heart disease, the diagnosis was changed to normal heart. In one of six neonates with clinically innocent murmurs, the diagnosis was changed to small muscular ventricular septal defect. We concluded that 84% of heart murmurs in neonates were due to heart diseases and only 16% were innocent murmurs. Although clinical evaluation could determine the presence or absence of heart disease in most neonates, the lesion-specific diagnosis was not quite satisfactory. Echocardiography is necessary for neonates with a clinically diagnosed heart disease or possible heart diseases, and may be unnecessary for those with innocent murmurs diagnosed by paediatricians."
