2,"A systematic review of RIFLE criteria in children, and its application and association with measures of mortality and morbidity.","The RIFLE criteria were developed to improve consistency in the assessment of acute kidney injury. The high face validity, collaborative development method, and validation against mortality have supported the widespread adoption of the RIFLE to evaluate adult patients; however, its inconsistent application in adult studies is associated with significant effects on the estimated incidence of acute kidney injury. As the RIFLE criteria are now being used to determine acute kidney injury in children, we conducted a systematic review to describe its application and assess associations between the RIFLE and measures of mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients. In 12 studies we found wide variation in the application of the RIFLE, including the range of assessed RIFLE categories, omission of urine output criteria, varying definitions of baseline renal function, and methods for handling missing baseline measurements. Limited and conflicting associations between the RIFLE and mortality, length of stay, illness severity, and measures of kidney function were found. Thus, although the RIFLE was developed to improve the consistency of defining acute kidney injury, there are still major discrepancies in its use in pediatric patients that may undermine its potential utility as a standardized measure of acute kidney injury in children."
3,Clinical review: RIFLE and AKIN--time for reappraisal.,"In recent years, the use of the consensus definitions of acute kidney injury (RIFLE and AKIN) in the literature has increased substantially. This indicates a highly encouraging acceptance by the medical community of a unifying definition for acute kidney injury. This is a very important and positive step in the right direction. There remains some variation in how the criteria are interpreted and used in the literature, including use/nonuse of urine output criteria, use of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate rather than change in creatinine, and choice of baseline creatinine. The present review is intended to aid the reader in critically appraising studies using these consensus definitions. Since no single definition will be perfect, a logical next step would be to reconcile existing definitions, moving the medical community towards using a single consensus definition as has been done with sepsis and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. As new data emerge, integration of novel biomarkers into the consensus definition will be a welcome refinement."

6,Renal management in the critically ill patient.,"Acute kidney injury is common in the hospital setting and morbidity and mortality outcomes depend on early recognition and early intervention. Identifying patients at risk of acute kidney injury is critical in prevention, early identification, and appropriate treatment."
7,Defining acute renal failure: RIFLE and beyond.,"The introduction of the RIFLE classification has increased the conceptual understanding of the acute kidney injury (AKI) syndrome, and this classification has been successfully tested in a number of clinical studies. This review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the RIFLE classification and suggests additional parameters to broaden future definitions of AKI. These definitions should not only focus on kidney function alone, but also include parameters describing the origin of the patient, the most important causal factors responsible for AKI and information on the pre-existing kidney function. This more complete definition should lead to a decrease in the variability of the results of epidemiological studies and of future clinical trials in AKI populations."
8,Risk Stratification for Targeted AKI Prevention After Surgery: Biomarkers and Bundled Interventions.,"Perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a surgery-associated complication with increasing incidence, not only because of enhanced awareness for the diagnosis, but also as a result of the aging society with a growing number of severe comorbidities undergoing major surgical procedures. The dilemma of AKI as a global health burden lies in the discrepancy between its importance as a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and the unavailability of specific therapies to modify these adverse outcomes. Thus, it is all the more important to focus management on AKI prevention, and when AKI occurs to focus on early recognition and immediate adaption of individualized care. AKI is the result of an inter-relationship between patient susceptibility and determinants of perioperative exposures. Screening for constellations of risk factors along with measurement of novel biomarkers allows for early identification of patients who are susceptible to AKI and to initiate early targeted care. Targeted care involves implementation of a bundle of interventions adapted from a consensus management guideline, and is a strategy with growing evidence of a beneficial effect on patients' short- and long-term outcomes."
9,[Kidney Injury in Newborns with Abdominal Compartment Syndrome].,"The review represents the problems of a damage to the vital organs in newborns with the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS). Particular attention is paid to the key predisposing factors and key links of the renal damage's pathogenesis in newborns with ACS. This review presents the latest data about the role of the hypoxia at the initiation of damage of the renal parenchyma, the prospectsfor the use of various molecular markers for early diagnostics of nephropathy. Creation of molecular cell test system for the diagnostics and monitoring of renal damage in newborns with ACS is a promising trend in the treatment and prevention nephropathy in newborns."
