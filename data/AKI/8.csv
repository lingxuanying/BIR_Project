0,Management of Acute Kidney Injury in Pregnancy for the Obstetrician.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder that occurs in several clinical settings. During pregnancy, there are additional unique conditions that contribute to AKI. The clinical manifestations of AKI during pregnancy range from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, similar to AKI in the general population. Recent epidemiologic studies in the general population show an increase in mortality associated with AKI, particularly when dialysis is required. The incidence of AKI in pregnancy remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality."

2,Pathophysiology and management of septic acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a commonly encountered complication in critically ill children and portends a worse prognosis. Sepsis-induced AKI (SAKI) is a leading contributor to AKI in children and significantly modifies the risk for less favorable outcome. It has increasingly become clear that SAKI represents a unique and distinct cause of AKI. Studies focused on renal hemodynamics, bioenergetics, and immune-mediated injury have provided further insights into the pathobiology of SAKI; however, many of the nuanced mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Although there have been numerous strategies evaluated for the prevention and management of SAKI, no specific intervention has proven unequivocally efficacious. Currently, the mainstays for managing SAKI focus on alleviating ongoing kidney damage by optimizing systemic and kidney hemodynamic support, avoiding nephrotoxins, and mitigating the anticipated complications of kidney failure. The timely referral for renal support to manage azotemia, metabolic derangements, and fluid accumulation remains critical for this population. The extracorporeal removal of inflammatory mediators has shown some potential benefit in limiting systemic and kidney immune-mediated injury; however, the precise role of these technologies in the management of SAKI has yet to be defined."

4,Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized Pediatric Patients: A Review of Research.,"Introduction: Pediatric patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) while hospitalized have longer hospital stays, increased morbidity and mortality, and are at an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease. Early recognition of AKI is becoming a major clinical focus. There is little research focusing on nursing interventions that may affect a pediatric patient's risk for developing AKI. The purpose of this review is to summarize reported predictors of AKI to improve its early recognition and treatment among hospitalized pediatric patients. Methods: A review of research was conducted to further identify risk factors of AKI among noncritically ill hospitalized pediatric patients. Results: The current literature demonstrated inconsistent findings in early recognition of AKI among hospitalized pediatric patients. Discussion: Interventions for early recognition and treatment of AKI should consider other variables, such as previous history of AKI and fluid status as risk factors, warranting additional research."
5,Acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among critically ill patients and results in increased mortality in this population. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of AKI. The authors first explore new aspects of diagnosis, including new criteria that take into account even modest changes in renal function, and the development of novel biomarkers to allow earlier identification and better differential diagnosis of AKI. The authors also explore the available data on choice of dialysis modality and dialysis dose for the treatment of AKI, as well as the breakthrough development of the bioartificial kidney. Last, the authors review co-interventions that may have relevance to prognosis of AKI, such as intensive insulin therapy and the use of erythropoietin."
6,Prevention and Management of Acute Kidney Injury: What a Physician Should Know.,"The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasing worldwide. The increase is attributable not only to ageing population with multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, increasing use of contrast for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures but also to the fact that now it is being recognized more often. The 'Zero by 25' initiative by International Society of Nephrology aims at preventing all avoidable deaths from AKI worldwide by the year 2025. It calls for greater awareness about management of AKI among primary care physicians. In last few years, various concepts have emerged regarding prevention and management of AKI. This review aims at consolidating and applying these concepts to the '5R approach' for management of AKI introduced by Lewington."
7,Strategies to Avoid TAVI-related Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is relatively common in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and has been associated with increased mortality and worse outcomes. The administration of iodinated contrast media in an elderly population with increased rates of chronic kidney injury and heart failure, the risk of hemodynamic compromise and the use of large catheters intra-procedurally make patients undergoing TAVI particularly vulnerable to renal insults and AKI. Furthermore, these patients are commonly exposed to iodinated contrast media during diagnostic and possible interventional procedures pre-TAVI. While risk factors such as baseline comorbidities are non-modifiable, others such as administration of nephrotoxic medications, the type and amount of contrast medium and the catheters size can be avoided, modified and improved. In addition, numerous other interventions such as volume expansion and possibly medications can prevent contrast related kidney injury. In this review, we sought to focus on strategies aiming at reducing the incidence of TAVI-related AKI."
8,Role of renal biomarkers as predictors of acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery.,"Cardiac surgery is unique in using cardiopulmonary bypass in various clinical scenarios. Injury of vital organs is unavoidable in the perioperative period. Acute kidney injury is a consequence of the systemic inflammatory response after bypass, emboli, ischemia, and low cardiac output states, reportedly occurring in 30%-40% of open heart surgeries. Acute kidney injury is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. Many preventive measures (off-pump procedures, decreased crossclamp time, pulsatile flow, adequate hydration) are taken in the perioperative period to avoid organ injury, but in vain. Traditionally, blood urea, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance rate were applied for prediction of acute kidney injury. The recent emergence of biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cystatin C, liver-type fatty acid binding protein, interleukin-18, kidney injury molecule-1, and tetrahydrobiopterin have helped in detecting acute kidney injury long before the rise of serum creatinine. These biomarkers can also be used as tools for predicting therapeutic effects in acute kidney injury and for monitoring drug toxicity. This review consolidates the knowledge of biomarkers and their application in acute kidney injury management."
9,Acute kidney injury in 2013: Breaking barriers for biomarkers in AKI--progress at last.,"In 2013, four important papers were published that provide new insights on biomarkers in acute kidney injury (AKI). These studies demonstrate the potential for biomarkers to aid clinicians in improving the therapeutic management of patients with AKI and potentially improve patient outcomes."
