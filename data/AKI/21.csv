0,AKI Adjudication: Do We Need It.,"Adjudication, which comes from the Latin term ""adjudicare"" (to act as a judge), uses expert opinion to define and classify disease entities. The use of clinical adjudication may help to define more homogeneous disease subsets but comes at the expense of effort needed and generalizability. Here, we will describe the pros and cons of acute kidney injury (AKI) adjudication under varied circumstances. We will use heart failure as a paradigm and provide comparable examples from the current AKI literature."
1,Acute renal failure in the elderly: epidemiology and clinical features.,"Structural and functional alterations affecting the aging kidney predispose to an increased risk of acute renal failure (ARF) in the elderly. This is a common problem becoming more relevant because of an increase in life expectancy. The epidemiology of ARF in the elderly is far from being well assessed, because of the lack of uniform definition criteria, variable etiology, coexistence of several comorbidities, and the various clinical settings and geographic areas where the condition is managed, with a higher incidence in developed regions where elderly patients predominate. In 2004, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group proposed the RIFLE criteria for diagnosis and stratification of ARF. More recently, the Acute Kidney Injury Network proposed several refinements to the RIFLE criteria, and the use of the term acute kidney injury (AKI) has been suggested to mean any abrupt reduction in kidney function, while restricting use of the term ARF to severe dysfunction requiring renal replacement treatment. Although in elderly patients the more frequent forms of AKI are functional or obstructive, parenchymal AKI, such as acute tubular necrosis and contrast-induced nephropathy, still frequently occur. Elderly patients with chronic renal disease (CKD) who develop AKI are at high risk for mortality, and are prone to non-recovery from AKI and progression to more advanced stages of CKD and even to end-stage renal disease. Panels of AKI biomarkers are likely to improve early diagnosis and treatment, thus reducing morbidity and mortality of older patients from this condition in the future."

4,Renal replacement therapy in children.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects 3.9/1000 at-risk children in the United States, a number that has been increasing as critically ill and injured children have access to improved care and the diagnosis of AKI is being made more accurately. Children with AKI have a higher mortality and hospital length of stay as compared to children without AKI. Renal replacement therapy can improve outcomes in these patients. This article reviews the pathophysiology of AKI and the modalities, indications, and outcomes of renal replacement for children with AKI."
5,The kidney in the critically ill.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in the intensive care setting. It seldom occurs in isolation, but is mostly part of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The pathogenesis is frequently multifactorial, with sepsis contributing to 50% of the cases.The development of AKI in critically-ill patients is ""bad news"": patients with AKI have a high morbidity and mortality. In addition, AKI, even in its mildest from, is not only a marker of illness severity but appears to be independently associated with mortality. Prevention of AKI is therefore a major goal to improve outcome of critically-ill patients. Treatment of established AKI is largely supportive. The optimal modality for renal replacement therapy in critically-ill patients still remains a matter of debate). The majority of survivors recover renal function."
6,Acute renal failure.,"Acute renal failure occurs in 5 percent of hospitalized patients. Etiologically, this common condition can be categorized as prerenal, intrinsic or postrenal. Most patients have prerenal acute renal failure or acute tubular necrosis (a type of intrinsic acute renal failure that is usually caused by ischemia or toxins). Using a systematic approach, physicians can determine the cause of acute renal failure in most patients. This approach includes a thorough history and physical examination, blood tests, urine studies and a renal ultrasound examination. In certain situations, such as when a patient has glomerular disease, microvascular disease or obstructive disease, rapid diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent permanent renal damage. By maintaining euvolemia, recognizing patients who are at increased risk and minimizing exposure to nephrotoxins, physicians can decrease the incidence of acute renal failure. Once acute renal failure develops, supportive therapy is critical to maintain fluid and electrolyte balances, minimize nitrogenous waste production and sustain nutrition. Death is most often caused by infection or cardiorespiratory complications."

8,Year in review 2012: Critical Care--Nephrology.,"We summarize original research in the field of critical care nephrology accepted or published in 2012 in Critical Care and, when considered relevant or directly linked to this research, in other journals. Three main topics have been identified for a rapid overview: acute kidney injury, detailed in some pathogenetic and epidemiological aspects; fluid overload as a predictor of mortality both in acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients; and RRT, evaluating some features of citrate anticoagulation and describing the effects of RRT modalities or timing on survival."
