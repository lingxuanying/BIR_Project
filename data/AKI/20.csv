3,Challenges of care for the patient with acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be a devastating problem for hospitalized patients. Whether it is acute or chronic renal failure, or a result of prerenal, postrenal, or intrarenal causes, AKI greatly increases mortality as well as inpatient cost. This article provides an overview of AKI, along with specific information to arm the infusion nurse to optimize patient care for the long term."
4,Neonatal RIFLE.,"A standardized classification of acute kidney injury (AKI) has recently been proposed with the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, End-stage kidney disease) score. Such definition/classification has been applied both in adult and in paediatric patients. Neonatal definition of AKI likely results as a challenging task due to the peculiar renal pathophysiology of newborn critically ill patients. Their so-called 'immature kidneys' require careful management and neonatal AKI is frequently complicated by unfavourable outcomes. A recent attempt to implement the RIFLE score with a neonatal modification might lead to improvement on the knowledge of AKI incidence and epidemiology."

6,Controversies in acute kidney injury: the 2011 Brussels Roundtable.,"The recent advent of consensus definitions for acute kidney injury (AKI) has led to improvement in epidemiology of this complex disease and facilitated the development of new diagnostic makers and new therapies. However, important new challenges are also apparent. We still do not really understand why AKI occurs and urgently need to develop new therapies to treat it. Progress in this area will require new ideas and thinking outside the conventional box. By confronting some of the most significant controversies in the field of AKI we seek to develop new concepts that will ultimately yield new results."

8,Kinetic Glomerular Filtration Rate in Routine Clinical Practice-Applications and Possibilities.,"When the [creatinine] is changing, the kidney function can still be tracked with a quantitative technique called kinetic glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The equation yields useful information on the severity of acute kidney injury, the clinical course of kidney and dialysis clearances, and the timing of kidney recovery. It has been validated in at least 3 independent studies, where it performed sufficiently well in intensive care unit and kidney transplant settings, and in head-to-head comparisons with biomarkers. Because it is based on a mathematical model, the kinetic GFR faces limitations depending on the accuracy of its assumptions. As the assumptions more accurately reflect the complexities of biology, some of these limitations can be overcome in a more sophisticated model. Kinetic GFR is an easy-to-use, low-cost tool that should be more widely incorporated into medical practice."
