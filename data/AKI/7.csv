0,"Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury: Pathophysiology, Manifestations, Prevention, and Management.","Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a phenomenon that has been extensively studied throughout the years. There is a large volume of literature documenting this risk, and most radiology departments and radiologists use this information when making decisions regarding contrast administration. A review of the current information on the topic of contrast-induced acute kidney injury is necessary to ensure that the risks of intravenous contrast are properly weighed against the benefits of a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan."
1,An update and review of acute kidney injury in pediatrics.,"Objectives: To inform the pediatric intensivist of recent advancements in acute kidney injury diagnosis and management. Data sources: Studies were identified from MEDLINE (OVID), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for topics relevant to acute kidney injury. We also reviewed bibliographies of relevant studies. DATA EXTRACTION, SYNTHESIS, AND OUTLINE REVIEW: Because of the lack of prospective trials, a majority of information is extracted from observational and retrospective data. The pathophysiology section reviews acute kidney injury mechanisms and highlights data regarding distal injury from experimental acute kidney injury. The epidemiology section focuses on incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury, highlighting new strategies for diagnosis. The management section cites studies investigating hemodynamic optimization, nutrition, and fluid management, including the indications and impact of continuous renal replacement therapy in fluid overload. Conclusions: There is limited data-driven evidence in pediatrics regarding effective therapy for acute kidney injury, a significant problem in the pediatric intensive care unit extending length of stay, ventilator days, and overall mortality. Sublethal kidney injury may be contributing to overall morbidity. We conclude that prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate specific diagnostic aids, such as biomarkers, and therapeutic strategies, such as early initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy in children with fluid overload."
2,Acute renal failure.,"This seminar covers the most recent information on definition, epidemiology, and clinical causes of acute renal failure. The mechanisms of acute prerenal failure and the potential interference by commonly used drugs of autoregulation of renal blood flow are discussed. We summarise some basic and recent insights into the haemodynamic and cellular pathophysiological mechanisms, mainly of postischaemic acute renal failure. Recent findings on the repair mechanisms of renal injury and the potential future therapeutic possibilities are discussed. We provide some differential diagnostic approaches for patients with acute renal failure and summarise prevention of the disorder and management of critically ill patients by dialysis and by other means. Finally, some information on the influence of gene polymorphisms on the prognosis of acute renal failure is given."
3,Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.,"Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a common and serious postoperative complication of cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and it is the second most common cause of AKI in the intensive care unit. Although the complication has been associated with the use of CPB, the etiology is likely multifactorial and related to intraoperative and early postoperative management including pharmacologic therapy. To date, very little evidence from randomized trials supporting specific interventions to protect from or prevent AKI in broad cardiac surgery populations has been found. The definition of AKI employed by investigators influences not only the incidence of CSA-AKI, but also the identification of risk variables. The advent of novel biomarkers of kidney injury has the potential to facilitate the subclinical diagnosis of CSA-AKI, the assessment of its severity and prognosis, and the early institution of interventions to prevent or reduce kidney damage. Further studies are needed to determine how to optimize cardiac surgical procedures, CPB parameters, and intraoperative and early postoperative blood pressure and renal blood flow to reduce the risk of CSA-AKI. No pharmacologic strategy has demonstrated clear efficacy in the prevention of CSA-AKI; however, some agents, such as the natriuretic peptide nesiritide and the dopamine agonist fenoldopam, have shown promising results in renoprotection. It remains unclear whether CSA-AKI patients can benefit from the early institution of such pharmacologic agents or the early initiation of renal replacement therapy."
4,[Renal Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury - Indication and Implementation].,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients and is associated with a worse short- and long-term outcome. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines suggest to implement preventive strategies in high-risk patients. Definition and classification of acute kidney injury according to the KDIGO criteria are based on an increase in serum creatinine and/or a decrease in urinary output. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is the only supportive measure in patients with severe AKI. The KDIGO guidelines recommend to initiate RRT immediately if an absolute indication exists. However, in the absence of absolute indication, there are no recommendations when to start RRT in AKI patients with a progressive decline of renal function. Continuous or intermittent techniques of renal replacement therapy may be used equally for treatment of acute kidney injury. In hemodynamically instable patients and patients with increased intracranial pressures continuous renal replacement therapy is recommended. Although weak evidence exists, regional citrate anticoagulation is suggested for patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy and systemic heparin anticoagulation is suggested for patients receiving intermittent renal replacement therapy. The KDIGO guidelines recommend to deliver an effluent volume of 20 - 25 ml/kg/h for CRRT in AKI."
5,Acute kidney injury: definitions and new paradigms.,"Changes in terminology and new consensus definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI) and stages of severity have simplified some of the problems in the clinical approach to this complex syndrome. Nevertheless, new proactive approaches to the diagnosis of kidney injury instead of kidney failure are required to allow clinical translation of successful therapies developed for experimental AKI. The recent development of novel urinary and plasma biomarkers, which predict kidney failure, has allowed the development of new paradigms for detection, prevention, and stage-specific treatment."
6,Acute kidney injury following acute pancreatitis: A review.,"BACKROUND. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common serious complication of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and an important marker of morbidity and mortality in critically ill septic patients. AKI due to severe acute pancreatitis can be the result of hypoxemia, release of pancreatic amylase from the injured pancreas with impairment of renal microcirculation, decrease in renal perfusion pressure due to abdominal compartment syndrome, intraabdominal hypertension or hypovolemia. Endotoxins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play an important role in the pathophysiology of SAP and AKI. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of AKI following SAP might improve the therapeutic outcome of critically ill patients. Methods and results: An overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and potential treatment options based on a literature search of clinical human and experimental studies from 1987 to 2013. Conclusions: Early recognition of AKI and SAP in order to prevent severe complication like septic shock, intraabdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is a crucial tool of therapeutic measures in intensive care."
7,Mechanisms of acute kidney injury.,
8,[Recognizing pediatric acute kidney injury].,Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a reversible increase in blood concentration of creatinine and nitrogenous waste products and by the inability of the kidney to regulate fluid and electrolyte homeostasis appropriately. AKI in hospitalized patients is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality in pediatric and adult populations. Continued reliance on serum creatinine and urine output for the diagnosis of AKI has resulted in an inability to provide successful therapeutic and supportive interventions to prevent and mitigate AKI. Research efforts over the last decade have foused on the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers to detect AKI prior to a change in kidney function and to make a differential diagnosis of AKI.
9,Pathophysiology and Clinical Work-Up of Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI), also known in the past as acute renal failure, is a syndrome characterized by the rapid loss of kidney excretory function. It is usually diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output or both. AKI is the clinical consequence of several disorders that acutely affect the kidney, causing electrolytes and acid-base imbalance, hyperhydration and loss of depurative function. AKI is common in critical care patients in whom it is often secondary to extrarenal events. No specific therapies can attenuate AKI or accelerate renal function recovery; thus, the only treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques such as renal biomarkers might improve early diagnosis. Also ultrasonography helps nephrologists in AKI diagnosis, in order to describe and follow kidney alterations and find possible causes of AKI. Renal replacement therapy is a life-saving treatment if AKI is severe. If patients survive to AKI, and did not have previous chronic kidney disease (CKD), they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had AKI are at increased risk of subsequent CKD."
