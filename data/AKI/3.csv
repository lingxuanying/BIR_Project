0,Prerenal acute kidney injury-still a relevant term in modern clinical practice?,"The traditional taxonomy of acute kidney injury (AKI) has remained pervasive in clinical nephrology. While the terms 'prerenal', 'intrarenal' and 'postrenal' highlight the diverse pathophysiology underlying AKI, they also imply discrete disease pathways and de-emphasize the nature of AKI as an evolving clinical syndrome with multiple, often simultaneous and overlapping, causes. In a similar vein, prerenal AKI comprises a diverse spectrum of kidney disorders, albeit one that is often managed by using a standardized clinical algorithm. We contend that the term 'prerenal' is too vague to adequately convey our current understanding of hypoperfusion-related AKI and that it should thus be avoided in the clinical setting. Practice patterns among nephrologists indicate that AKI-related terminology plays a significant role in the approaches that clinicians take to patients that have this complex disease. Thus, it appears that precise terminology does impact the treatment that patients receive. We will outline differences in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions lying on the so-called prerenal disease spectrum to advocate caution when administering intravenous fluids to these clinically decompensated patients. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may, thus, avert clinical missteps such as fluid and vasopressor mismanagement in tenuous or critically ill patients."
1,[Perioperative acute kidney injury].,"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in the perioperative period and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. AKI is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines define AKI based on increases in serum creatinine and/or urinary output. Since there is no causal therapy available, early detection and timely implementation of preventive measures are of particular importance. Objective: This article gives an overview of the disease picture of perioperative AKI. The recommendations on diagnostics, prevention and treatment are presented. Methods: The available evidence is summarized based on the currently available literature. Results: New renal biomarkers demonstrate kidney stress and are able to make an early prediction of the development of AKI. The implementation of the KDIGO bundles (discontinuation of all nephrotoxic medications, optimization of the volume status and perfusion pressure, consideration of an extended functional hemodynamic monitoring, close monitoring of serum creatinine concentration and urine output, avoidance of hyperglycemia and consideration of alternatives to radiocontrast agents) and remote ischemic preconditioning have shown a significant reduction in the incidence of AKI in high-risk patients. Conclusion: For timely diagnosis and prevention of AKI the recommendations for action of the KDIGO guidelines should be implemented. High-risk patients should be detected early in the perioperative period in order to be able to initiate preemptive strategies in a timely manner."
2,[Acute kidney injury in elderly patients].,"In the last few years, more and more studies have been focusing on Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) because of its incidence, its effects on patients, and the costs associated to its treatment. Elderly patients are especially in danger of developing AKI given the para-physiological deterioration of their renal functions and the presence of several co-morbidities. Together with sepsis, AKI is in fact one of the most common complications occurring during hospitalization. However, some strategies have proved to help in preventing renal damage in the elderly. Fluid overload, malnutrition and sepsis, which are far more common and momentous in older patients, can conceal or minimize rising creatinine levels. As such, it is not always possible to rely on the creatinine behaviour to diagnose AKI as proposed by KDIGO, AKIN e RIFLE guidelines. On the one hand, these and other peculiarities make AKI very difficult to diagnose and treat in elderly patients. On the other, the dialysis treatment, with its intrinsic ""un-physiology"", further complicates matters and (if it is very aggressive in terms of efficiency and removal of fluids) can destabilize these fragile patients and their poor haemodynamic compensation."
3,Acute Kidney Injury Risk Recognition in Resource-Sufficient Versus Resource-Limited Regions.,"Acute kidney injury is a very common complication of acute illnesses with dire consequences. There are significant differences in incidence, etiology, severity, and clinical impact of acute kidney injury between resource-sufficient and resource-limited regions. Awareness of such differences would potentially allow clinicians and policymakers to devise and provide region-specific interventions to decrease the incidence of acute kidney injury and mitigate its complications. In this review article, we describe the similarities and differences of acute kidney injury risk factors and risk stratifications based on the level of resource availability in different regions. We also outline differences between community- and hospital-acquired acute kidney injury in different countries. In the end, we outline the potential steps need to be taken to mitigate incidence and clinical impacts of acute kidney injury in both resource-sufficient and resource-limited regions."
4,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2-Associated Acute Kidney Injury: A Narrative Review Focused Upon Pathophysiology.,"Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury is a condition that in many ways resembles classical acute kidney injury. The pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial, and accordingly, our main objective was to review possible components of this form of acute kidney injury. Data sources: Literature review. Data synthesis: Our principal observation was that the various components of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury appear to be relatively similar to the classical forms. Temporality of injury is an important factor but is not specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury. Several insults hit the kidney at different moments in the course of disease, some occurring prior to hospital admission, whereas others take place at various stages during hospitalization. Conclusions and relevance: Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury cannot be approached in a ""one-size-fits-all"" manner. The numerous mechanisms involved do not occur simultaneously, leading to a multiple hit model that may contribute to the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury. A personalized approach to each patient with acute kidney injury based on the timing and severity of disease is necessary in order to provide appropriate treatment. Although data from the literature regarding the previous coronavirus infections can give some insights, more studies are needed to explore the different mechanisms of acute kidney injury occurring as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2."
5,Acute Kidney Injury in Active Wars and Other Man-Made Disasters.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent during wars and other man-made disasters, and contributes significantly to the overall death toll. War-related AKI may develop as a result of polytrauma, traumatic bleeding and hypovolemia, chemical and airborne toxin exposure, and crush syndrome. Thus, prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal AKI may develop at the battlefield, in field hospitals, or tertiary care centers, resulting not only from traumatic, but also nontraumatic, etiologies. The prognosis usually is unfavorable because of systemic and polytrauma-related complications and suboptimal therapeutic interventions. Measures for decreasing the risk of AKI include making preparations for foreseeable disasters, and early management of polytrauma-related complications, hypovolemia, and other pathogenetic mechanisms. Transporting casualties initially to field hospitals, and afterward to higher-level health care facilities at the earliest convenience, is critical. Other man-made disasters also may cause AKI; however, the number of patients is mostly lower and treatment possibilities are broader than in war. If there is no alternative other than prolonged field care, the medical community must be prepared to offer health care and even perform dialysis in austere conditions, which in that case, is the only option to decrease the death toll resulting from AKI."

7,Acute kidney injury and 'nephrotoxins': mind your language.,"The introduction of the term 'acute kidney injury' (AKI) along with an international classification scheme,1 caused some initial confusion, but most clinicians and many patients now understand that the term 'injury' denotes damage to the internal workings of the kidney, rather than physical trauma. However, of greater concern is the use of the term 'nephrotoxic' to include drugs that are, in most settings, nephroprotective. We argue that this imprecise terminology, unfortunately adopted by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) among others, is potentially harmful, and that the terms 'nephrotoxin' and 'nephrotoxic' should not be used to describe haemodynamically mediated and fully reversible effects of some drugs on excretory function."
8,Roles for fibroblast growth factor-23 and alpha-Klotho in acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury is a global disease with high morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have revealed that the fibroblast growth factor-23-α-Klotho axis is closely related to chronic kidney disease, and has multiple biological functions beyond bone-mineral metabolism. However, although dysregulation of fibroblast growth factor-23-α-Klotho has been observed in acute kidney injury, the role of fibroblast growth factor-23-α-Klotho in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury remains largely unknown. In this review, we describe recent findings regarding fibroblast growth factor-23-α-Klotho, which is mainly involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and hemodynamic disorders. Further, based on these recent results, we put forth novel insights regarding the relationship between the fibroblast growth factor-23-α-Klotho axis and acute kidney injury, which may provide new therapeutic targets for treating acute kidney injury."
9,Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury: pathophysiology and diagnostic modalities and management.,"Acute kidney injury is a disease spectrum that can present with from mild renal dysfunction to complete renal failure that would require renal replacement therapy. Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury is a complication that carries a grave disease burden. Risk factors are identified as being either modifiable or non-modifiable. This literature review aims to define the pathophysiology of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury, the current definition and classification of acute kidney injury and the available diagnostic modalities, especially the use of biomarkers."
