0,Radiologic contrast-induced renal failure.,"RCIRF is a complex syndrome resulting in acute renal dysfunction following exposure to radiologic contrast media. It accounts for 10 per cent of all cases of acute renal failure. The pathogenesis appears multifactorial but most probably involves contrast-mediated renal ischemia and direct tubular toxicity. Significant risk factors include preexisting renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, volume depletion, and presence of multiple myeloma. The diagnosis should be suspected with acute renal dysfunction temporally related to radiologic contrast administration. The prognosis for recovery is good in most cases. Key preventive measures include identification of high-risk patients, ensuring adequate hydration prior to contrast agent administration, avoiding excessive and repeated contrast exposure, and instituting prophylactic therapy in selected cases."

2,Acute renal failure in hospitalized patients: part II.,"Background: Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common condition in hospitalized patients. Research has been unable to identify the optimal target for therapeutic intervention; hence, effective prevention of and/or treatment for ARF remain elusive. Objective: To examine the usefulness of current and potential pharmacologic treatments in seriously ill, hospitalized patients. Data sources: A MEDLINE search (1996-June 2002) was conducted using the search terms kidney (drug effects) and acute kidney failure (drug therapy). Bibliographies of selected articles were also examined to include all relevant investigations. Study selection and data extraction: Review articles, meta-analyses, and clinical trials describing prevention of and treatment for hospital-acquired ARF were identified. Results from prospective, controlled trials were given priority when available. Conclusions: Appropriate management of ARF includes prospective identification of at-risk patients, fluid administration, and optimal hemodynamic support. Drug treatments, including low-dose dopamine and diuretics, have demonstrated extremely limited benefits and have not been shown to improve patient outcome. Experimental agents influence cellular processes of renal dysfunction and recovery; unfortunately, relatively few drugs show promise for the future."
3,Acute renal failure in the surgical patient: initial diagnosis and treatment.,"Three categories of acute renal failure have been identified: prerenal, postrenal, and renal. Prerenal failure results from decreased perfusion of the kidney and postrenal failure from obstruction distal to the nephron; renal failure, in the surgical setting, usually represents acute tubular necrosis. A rational approach to the diagnosis of acute renal failure is outlined, and the treatment of acute tubular necrosis is discussed. High-risk factors are identified, and the importance of maintaining intravascular volume to prevent acute renal failure is stressed, since the mortality rate may approach 50% in patients in whom this perioperative complication develops."

5,Acute renal failure in childhood.,"The definition of acute renal failure is a sudden reduction in renal function of at least 50 percent and is characterised by rising serum levels of waste products such as urea and creatinine, by disturbed water and electrolyte metabolism and changes in the amount or composition of the urine. The clinical manifestations are extremely variable, there are very many causes and the outcome depends mainly on the underlying condition, which is either in the kidneys or in the body as a whole. This paper will discuss the pathophysiology of acute renal failure and the aetiology including prerenal, renal and postrenal causes. Clinical findings, diagnosis and treatment will be discussed and complications of this life-threatening condition highlighted. The final part of the paper deals with the prognosis of acute renal failure."

7,Kidney crisis in systemic sclerosis.,"Renal crisis in systemic sclerosis occurs in the group of patients with rapid and aggressive course of the disease, often after several years of the ailment and with the diffuse form. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is most frequently characterized by malignant hypertension, renal insufficiency, and less often by the symptoms of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Renal crisis symptoms appear suddenly and are not usually preceded by significant prodromal symptoms. SRC is always life-threatening and requires specific treatment with drugs blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme. Early diagnosis and introducing appropriate treatment give a patient a chance to survive SRC episode and improve his prognosis. SRC is of great importance to clinicians as it still causes high mortality rate. Chronic and subacute renal crisis is connected with a small risk of acute renal failure. However, it gradually leads to a substantial dysfunction of this organ. Thus, a useful examination in the diagnostics of chronic renal crisis is checking the vascular flow in renal cortex and evaluating intrarenal resistance."

9,[Factor analysis of clinical and paraclinical criteria determining the prognosis of acute renal damage].,"Aim: to identify risk factors and assess their significance in the development and prognosis of acute kidney injury in urological patients. Material and methods: The data of 6272 patients treated in the Department of Urology and Intensive care Unit were analyzed retro- and prospectively. Factorial and linear regression analyzes of the primary diagnostic criteria were carried out, which allowed to establish an impact of individual signs and their combination in determining the risk of developing or diagnosing existing renal dysfunction in the absence of clinical manifestations. Results: Statistical analysis has demonstrated the high significance of some diagnostic criteria (gender, increased body mass index, duration of the disease, comorbidities, hyperthermia, epitheliuria, proteinuria) influencing the development of acute kidney injury in patients with urolithiasis complicated by renal colic or secondary pyelonephritis. The factor load of each criterion allowed to establish the worst prognosis and the risk of progression of acute kidney injury in patients with frequent recurrences of secondary pyelonephritis, episodes of renal colic over the last 5 years, a combination of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus who underwent extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or pyelolithotomy with nephrostomy. These risk factors require for additional pharmacological protective therapy aimed at preventing the progression of acute kidney injury. Conclusions: Decreased urine output and serum creatinine levels as criteria for acute kidney injury (according to KDIGO) do not allow to fully assess the risk of renal dysfunction, which requires to consider additional criteria (gender, increased body mass index, duration of the disease, comorbidities, hyperthermia, epitheliuria, proteinuria) when taking history during the initial examination of a patient with upper urinary tract pathology."
