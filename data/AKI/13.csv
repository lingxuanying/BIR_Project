0,Approach to Acute Kidney Injuries in the Emergency Department.,"This article is an evidence-based overview of acute kidney injuries in patients seen in the emergency department setting. The article outlines the current definition of acute kidney injuries and most common causes of injuries. Furthermore, it details clinical evaluations important to appreciate and intervene on, such as volume overload, hypertension, life-threatening electrolyte derangements, and threshold for urgent dialysis. Finally, the article describes special populations that are at higher risk for acute kidney injuries and acute conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis, and the controversy of contrast-induced acute kidney injuries in patients seen in the emergency department."
1,Treatment of patients with cardiac surgery associated-acute kidney injury.,Members of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) participated in a 3-day conference in Vicenza in May 2007 to evaluate the available literature on this topic and draft consensus recommendations for research studies in this area. This report summarizes the available evidence and describes the key questions that will need to be addressed with the goal of standardizing the care of patients with cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) and improving outcomes.
2,", , RHABDOMYOLYSIS - INDUCED ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY - AN UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM.","Rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by muscle damage and the release of intracellular muscle contents into the circulation. It leads to a lot of complications e.g. hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and calcium disorders. The etiology is multifactorial. Severity ranges from mildly muscle weakness without any systemic complications, to life-threatening multi-organ damage. The most common and serious systemic complication is acute kidney injury (AKI). In the review, we address the epidemiology, causes, and treatment. The ideal would be to predict and prevent rhabdomyolysis at all, but when it is impossible, the key to successful treatment is its rapid implementation. Therapy should be selected individually, adapting to the triggers, and closely monitoring the patient's condition. Early implementation of fluid therapy appears to be crucial. Electrolyte disturbances should always be detected in the early stages and carefully treated. The use of bicarbonates or diuretics may also be helpful, but especially in the latter case, the indications should be well evaluated, remembering to avoid hypovolemia. Renal replacement therapy is often implemented due to water-electrolyte or acid-base disorders. Proper diagnosis and early therapy implementation improve patient outcomes, in particular in the face of new infectious dangers and global underestimating of the disease."
3,[Monitoring of kidney injury in preterm infants].,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in the neonatal intensive care unit that causes a high mortality of preterm infants and various chronic kidney diseases in adulthood. Preterm infants have immature development of the kidneys at birth. The kidneys continue to develop within a specific time window after birth. However, due to various factors during pregnancy and after birth, preterm infants tend to develop AKI. At present, serum creatinine and urine volume are used for the assessment of kidney injury, and their early sensitivity and specificity have attracted increasing attention. In recent years, various new biomarkers have been identified for early recognition of AKI. This article reviews the features, risk factors, renal function assessment, and prevention/treatment of AKI of preterm infants, in order to provide a reference for improving early diagnosis and treatment of AKI in preterm infants and long-term quality of life."
4,How new biomarkers aid the anesthetist to detect and prevent perioperative acute kidney injury.,"Purpose of review: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is underestimated but common in the perioperative setting. Although the association of this syndrome with an increased morbidity and mortality has been well established, little progress has been made in the diagnosis or prevention of AKI in recent years. This is partly due to the late detection of AKI by conventional criteria based of functional biomarkers, serum creatinine, and urine output. In addition, conceptually AKI is now recognized as being part of a continuum, in which preventive intervention is time critical. This review will summarize the current best available evidence and explain why timely perioperative management does have impact on the development of AKI and overall outcomes for patients. Recent findings: Damage biomarkers can reliably identify AKI earlier than conventional functional biomarkers, facilitating more timely preventive intervention. Although the interventions published in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline are all important, the most relevant preventive options perioperatively include maintenance of adequate volume status and perfusion pressure, and the focus on balanced crystalloid solutions as maintenance fluid. Summary: AKI is a time critical syndrome that requires timely detection and damage biomarkers can help to adjust the perioperative management to prevent further injury."
5,Acute kidney injury: prevention and recognition.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and often preventable. Nurses should be able to recognise it and respond when it occurs. Through prevention or early detection, nurses can help to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with AKI, improving patients' quality of life and reducing the financial impact of AKI on the NHS."

8,Moving beyond supportive care--current status of specific therapies in pediatric acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a significant challenge, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and medical costs. Therapy for AKI to this point has largely been supportive; specific interventions to treat established AKI have had minimal effect. Review of the pathogenesis of AKI reveals complex, interacting mechanisms, including changes in microcirculation, the immune system, and inflammation, and cell death from both necrosis and apoptosis. Past definitions of AKI have been imprecise; newer methods for AKI identification and classification, including novel biomarkers and improved criteria for defining AKI, may permit earlier intervention with greater potential for success. With improved understanding of pathophysiology and the opportunity for intervention before AKI is fully established, clinicians may be able to move beyond supportive care and improve outcomes."
