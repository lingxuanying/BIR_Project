0,Year in review 2013: Critical Care - nephrology.,"We review original research in the field of critical care nephrology accepted or published in 2013 in Critical Care and, when considered relevant or linked to these studies, in other journals. Three main topics have been identified and are discussed for a rapid overview: acute kidney injury (diagnosis, risk factors and outcome); timing and modality of renal replacement therapy; and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and renal dysfunction."

3,Treatment of acute renal failure.,"Acute renal failure is a life threatening illness whose mortality has remained high since the introduction of hemodialysis 25 years ago, despite advances in supportive care. Acute renal failure is an extremely morbid and costly disorder with a significant proportion of patients progressing to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. To the nephrologist, acute renal failure remains an extremely frustrating disease, because the pathophysiology is not well understood and the limited therapeutic options force the nephrologist to sit on the sidelines and wait for renal function to return. For example, dialysis remains the only FDA-approved treatment for acute renal failure, but dialysis may also cause renal injury that prolongs renal failure. The purpose of this perspective is to understand the results of the recent, largely negative, clinical trials in view of recent advances in the epidemiology of ARF. This review will also discuss diagnostic tools, strategies for improved design of clinical trials, and other therapeutic interventions that will be needed to properly treat acute renal failure in the 21st century."
4,[Acute kidney failure in critically ill patients and its prevention].,"Acute renal failure often complicates the course of critically illness and can contribute to high morbidity and mortality. In most cases acute renal failure represents a part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and it is usually related to the ischemic and/or toxic injury of tubular cells (acute tubular necrosis, ATN). The presented paper reviews the mechanisms involved in this two types of tubular cells injury. It analyzes the measures of kidney protection during critical illness, which include optimization of systemic and intrarenal hemodynamics as well as avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs. It describes the most common nephrotoxic drugs and proposes principles of their safer use. Potential strategies to stimulate kidney function recovery are also discussed."

9,Acute renal failure.,"The diagnosis and therapy of acute renal failure should be approached in concert, bearing in mind that more than one cause may co-exist in a patient. Therapy includes reversing prerenal and postrenal failure, removing any nephrotoxins, adjusting drug dosages, correcting acidemia, maintaining good nutritional status, and using dialysis when necessary."
