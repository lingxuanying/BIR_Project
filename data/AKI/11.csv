0,Drug-Induced Acute Kidney Injury: A Focus on Risk Assessment for Prevention.,"Drugs are the third to fifth leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients following sepsis and hypotension. Susceptibilities and exposures for development of AKI have been identified, and some are modifiable allowing for the possibility of AKI prevention or mitigation of AKI severity. Using drug therapies for prevention of AKI has been attempted but with little success in human studies, so we must rely on risk-assessment strategies for prevention. The purpose of this article is to review the risk factors, risk-assessment strategies, prevention, and management of drug-induced AKI with emphasis on risk assessment."

2,"Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis and Intervention in Acute Kidney Injury.","Biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) can be used for diagnosis and prognosis and to guide therapy. With no pharmacologic therapy clinically available for the treatment of AKI, prevention and early detection are of paramount importance. Despite the initial enthusiasm for biomarker use when it was first introduced in the literature, published studies' results have shown variability in biomarker performance. The following chapter will discuss what our expectations of AKI biomarkers should be and how they can be currently used for a variety of clinical purposes."
3,Perioperative acute kidney injury following major abdominal surgery.,"Major abdominal surgery is associated with significant morbidity, not least the development of acute kidney injury. As a common perioperative complication, acute kidney injury is associated with increased length of stay, increased risk of perioperative infection and the potential development of chronic kidney disease. Moreover, the development of acute kidney injury is independently associated with an increased risk of death. Perioperative acute kidney injury is not a single entity, but describes a clinical syndrome with multiple causes including physical causes related to the surgical procedure, ischaemia-reperfusion injury and the use of potential nephrotoxins. Currently, acute kidney injury is defined by changes in serum creatinine level and urine output criteria, which although robust in heterogenous populations, may not perform as accurately in the perioperative period. This article discusses these issues including the potential role of novel biomarkers for early detection of perioperative acute kidney injury, as well as the use of predictive modelling. Treatment is mainly supportive but evidence suggests that more targeted therapy may lead to improved outcomes."
4,Improving outcomes of acute kidney injury: report of an initiative.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder comprising several etiological factors and occurring in multiple settings. The disorder has a variety of clinical manifestations that range from minimal elevation in serum creatinine level to anuric renal failure. We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. This Acute Kidney Injury Network has proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI. These proposed standards will need to be validated in future studies, a process that will be facilitated by the Acute Kidney Injury Network, which offers a forum that encourages acquisition of knowledge to improve patient outcomes."
5,Advances and Challenges on New Therapies and Clinical Targets of Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is encountered in high-risk hospital settings where patients often suffer systemic illnesses, undergo surgery, or receive medications toxic to the kidneys. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in AKI, our ability to detect AKI early is limited, and outcomes remain unchanged. Once AKI is identified by the traditional markers of urine output and serum creatinine, the main therapeutic intervention is usually supportive care and/or renal replacement therapy until renal injury resolves. Urine biomarkers provide an optimistic future, offering the ability to identify patients at high risk for AKI such that preventative measures can be introduced. In this article, the etiologies of AKI are discussed, new biomarkers are assessed, and areas for further investigation are suggested."
6,AKI Associated with Acute Pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis is a common disorder of the pancreas. It is the most frequent gastrointestinal cause for hospitalization and one of the leading causes of in-hospital deaths. Its severity ranges from mild self-limited disease to severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis characterized by systemic complications and multiorgan failure. Severe acute pancreatitis develops in about 20% of patients with acute pancreatitis and may be associated with multiorgan failure (respiratory, cardiovascular, and kidney). AKI is a frequent complication of severe acute pancreatitis and develops late in the course of the disease, usually after the failure of other organs. It carries a very poor prognosis, particularly if kidney replacement therapy is required, with mortality rates exceeding 75%. The exact pathophysiology of AKI in acute pancreatitis remains unclear but appears to result from initial volume depletion followed by complex vascular and humoral factors. Here, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, causes, and management of AKI in patients with severe acute pancreatitis."

8,Molecular mechanisms of trauma-induced acute kidney injury: Inflammatory and metabolic insights from animal models.,"Trauma-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), such as after hemorrhagic shock (HS) or burn, remains a significant problem in the intensive care unit and is associated with increased mortality. The pathophysiology that drives AKI post-trauma is multi-factorial, and includes both inflammatory and metabolic alterations. Identifying the systemic profile that contributes to AKI is crucial not only for early diagnosis, but also for identifying treatments that improve kidney function and maintaining long-term patient health. In an effort to elucidate this molecular pathophysiology researchers have utilized a variety of animal models including chemically-induced (i.e., cisplatin), blocking renal perfusion (i.e., arterial clamping) and inducing burn or HS. As the latter burn and HS models are unequivocally applicable to studying AKI in the context of traumatic injury, this review will summarize the inflammatory and metabolic insights associated with AKI gained with these animal models. Moreover, novel therapeutic strategies brought forth with these models will be discussed."
9,[New KDIGO guidelines on acute kidney injury. Practical recommendations].,"The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients is very high and is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. In 2012 the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines were published in which evidence-based practical recommendations are given for the evaluation and management of patients with AKI. The first section of the KDIGO guidelines deals with the unification of earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. The subsequent sections of the guidelines cover the prevention and treatment of AKI as well as the management of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with AKI. In each section the existing evidence is discussed and a specific treatment recommendation is given. The guidelines appreciates that there is insufficient evidence for many of the recommendations. As a specific pharmacological therapy is missing, an early diagnosis, aggressive hemodynamic optimization, tight volume control, and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs are the only interventions to prevent AKI. If renal replacement therapy is required different modalities are available to provide an effective therapy with a low rate of adverse effects."
