4,Acute kidney injury: can we improve prognosis?,"The incidence of pediatric acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasing. AKI has been found to be independently associated with increased mortality, and current management options are limited in that they are mainly supportive. The use of various definitions of AKI can still be found in the literature, making it difficult to discern the epidemiology behind pediatric AKI. The use of a more uniform definition is a necessary first step to clarify AKI epidemiology and direct our research efforts, and it will ultimately improve prognosis. There is evidence that neonates and infants may be at higher risk for AKI than adults. However, the least amount of research is found for this youngest age group, and more focused efforts on this population are necessary. This paper reviews existing data on and definitions for pediatric AKI, general preventive and treatment strategies, as well as ongoing research efforts on AKI. We are hopeful that the prognosis of AKI will improve with collaboration on a multicenter, multinational scale in the form of prospective, long-term studies on pediatric AKI."
5,Acute Kidney Injury in the Geriatric Population.,"The aging kidney is more susceptible to injury. Thus, it is not surprising that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a disorder with a relative high incidence in the elderly population, especially those with critical illness. Given the comorbid conditions common in the geriatric population as well as the increase in exposure to various nephrotoxic insults, it is likely that the incidence of AKI will grow in the coming decades. Thus, it is critical to gain an understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways operative in increasing the susceptibility to AKI with an aim to design therapies that will mitigate the risk of AKI. In the meanwhile, meticulous attention to preventative strategic is critical. When AKI does occur and renal replacement therapy is needed, individual decision making is required and should not be based on age alone."
6,[Important to investigate the cause of acute kidney injury. Treatment should aim to limit the damage and prevent progression].,"An acute worsening of renal function, so called acute kidney injury, is common in patients admitted to hospital. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased long-term risk for chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death. In order to prevent further deterioration of kidney function early identification of causes for acute kindey injury is of utmost importance. In most cases, there is no specific treatment of acute kidney injury, but several general principles should be followed: to strive for normovolemia, optimize hemodynamics, treat electrolyte disturbances, discontinue nephrotoxic agents, and to adjust dosages of medications which are renally eliminated. The aim with this review was to provide an overview of the current knowledge for the initial management of acute kidney injury and to summarize the most important measures to take."
7,[Review of biomarkers for early diagnosis of acute kidney injury in patients with concomitant trauma].,"Modern methods for the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury using high-precision biomarkers in various pathological conditions, including patients with combined trauma, is reviewed in the article. The pathological processes of cell damage underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of acute kidney injury require a quick and early start of preventive measures. As a consequence, the problem of early diagnosis of acute kidney damage and search of ways to optimize it are still relevant. In case of a possible acute kidney injury, in addition to situations when the renal tissue is already damaged, it is very important to determine level of acute kidney injury biomarkers in biological fluids. The results of our clinical study carried out in the clinic of the Department of Faculty and Endoscopic surgery of the KBSU named after H.M. Berbekov, dedicated to the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury in patients with combined trauma using the serum biomarker cystatin , are also presented."
8,[Acute kidney injury].,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as an abrupt decline in the glomerular filtration rate with accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and the inability to maintain fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Occurring in 7% of all hospitalized patients and 28% to 35% of those in intensive care units, AKI increases hospital mortality. Early evaluation should include differentiating prerenal and postrenal components from intrinsic renal disease. Biological markers can give early warning of AKI and assist with differential diagnosis and assessment of prognosis. The most effective preventive measure is to maintain adequate circulation and cardiac output, avoiding ischemia- or nephrotoxin-induced injury. To that end, patients and situations of risk must be identified, hemodynamics and diuresis monitored, hypovolemia reversed, and nephrotoxins avoided. Protective agents such as sodium bicarbonate, mannitol, prostagiandins, calcium channel blockers, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, sodium deoxycholate, allopurinol, and pentoxifylline should be used. Treatment includes the elimination of prerenal and postrenal causes of AKI; adjustment of doses according to renal function; avoidance of both overhydration and low arterial pressure; maintenance of electrolytic balance, avoiding hyperkalemia and correcting hyperglycemia; and nutritional support, assuring adequate protein intake. For severe AKI, several modalities of renal replacement therapy, differentiated by mechanism and duration, are available. Timing--neither the best moment to start dialysis nor the optimal duration--has been not established. Early detection of AKI is necessary for preventing progression and starting renal replacement therapy at adjusted doses that reflect metabolic requirements."
9,Acute kidney injury: novel biomarkers and potential utility for patient care in urology.,"Urologists are integrally involved in the management of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is common after renal surgery or secondary to postrenal (obstructive) etiologies. The measurement of serum creatinine is a suboptimal indicator of AKI because it lags behind acute changes in renal function. Recent advances indicate that serum/urine biomarkers will prove useful for early detection of AKI, analogous to the use of cardiac enzymes for acute myocardial infarction. These serum/urine markers may guide future therapy, facilitate research efforts to reduce the severity of AKI, such as after partial nephrectomy, and allow for more accurate prognostication for patients with AKI."
