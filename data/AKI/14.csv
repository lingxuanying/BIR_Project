2,[Des-resuscitation in the overload of fluids associated with acute kidney injury].,"In the last few years the general results in the treatment of acute kidney injury has improved constantly, without a complete comprehension of its pathophysiology. With this paradigm in mind, in these last few years we have seen an evolving comprehension of the possible answers that may be based on recognizing the more proactive role of fluid management in the resuscitation of critical patients, not limited only to the delivery of fluids, but also to their active removal, having as the principal objective the improvement of tissue perfusion. The key role of vascular integrity in fluid overload is discussed, emphasizing the role of the endothelial glycocalyx. Active desresuscitation maneuvers with diuretics or with renal support therapies could be increasingly recognized instruments in the management of fluid overload, particularly in those patients with acute kidney injury."

4,Acute kidney injury: top ten tips.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality, and represents a significant financial burden for the NHS. The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcomes and Death (NCEPOD)'s report, Adding insult to injury, demonstrated that only 50% of patients who died from AKI received good care and 30% of patients had predictable and avoidable AKI. It is therefore essential to identify patients at risk of AKI early and to treat patients who develop it promptly. This article proposes how this may be achieved by highlighting ten top tips that describe the points along the patient pathway where it is possible to intervene and prevent or treat AKI. The tips emphasise the importance of good basic medical care and the need for engagement with patients, healthcare professionals and hospital processes. The implementation of these tips in hospitals across the UK could potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce associated costs."
5,Utility of bedside ultrasound derived hepatic and renal parenchymal flow patterns to guide management of acute kidney injury.,Purpose of review: Ideal fluid management of critically ill patients is maintaining an adequate perfusion pressure but avoiding venous congestion. Venous excess ultrasound score (VExUS) quantifies venous congestion to guide the management of fluid balance. Recent findings: VExUS of abdominal veins measures fluid tolerance and helps clinicians avoid congestion. VExUS scoring predicts the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) that is a common hospital problem resulting in higher mortality and morbidity. VExUS can predict patients at risk of developing AKI post cardiac surgery. VExUS has been associated with an increase in adverse outcomes in a general intensive care population. Hepatic vein ultrasound can manifest as a sequela of right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Intrarenal congestion suggests poorer prognosis in heart failure patients. VExUS score has been used in decision-making to remove fluid in patients with cardiorenal syndrome. VExUS scoring may help curtail overly aggressive fluid resuscitation for patients with septic shock and help avoid iatrogenic 'salt water drowning'. Summary: We summarize the technique and clinical practice of VExUS to help guide fluid balance across different populations of critically ill patients.
6,Acute kidney injury: global health alert.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional, and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians, and other health-care professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI."

8,The impact of e-alerts on inpatient diagnosis and management of acute kidney injury.,"Aims/background: Electronic alerts can help with the early detection of acute kidney injury in hospitalised patients. Evidence for their role in improving patient care is limited. The authors have completed an audit loop to evaluate the impact of electronic alerts, and an associated acute kidney injury management pathway, on patient care. Methods: The audits were conducted at a large tertiary care hospital in the UK. Case notes were reviewed for 99 patients over two periods: pre-alert (in 2013; n=55) and post-alert (in 2018; n=44), using the same methodology. Patients for case note reviews were randomly chosen from the list of acute kidney injury alerts generated by the local laboratory information management system. Results: Recognition of acute kidney injury, as documented in the case notes, increased from 15% to 43% between the two periods. Time to first medical review (following electronic alerts) improved by 17 minutes (median 4 hours 4 minutes in 2013 vs 3 hours 47 minutes in 2018). Completion of pre-defined acute kidney injury assessment tasks (review of vital signs, biochemistry and acid-base parameters, evidence of fluid balance assessment, consideration of possible sepsis, and examination or requesting urinalysis) improved in 2018. However, acute kidney injury management tasks (correction of hypovolaemia, addressing or investigating obstruction, medications review, renal referral, requesting of further biochemical tests, addressing possible sepsis) showed very little or no improvement. Conclusions: The introduction of acute kidney injury electronic alerts and management pathway resulted in improved recognition and initial assessment of patients with acute kidney injury. Further steps are needed to translate this in to improved patient management."
