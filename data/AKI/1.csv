0,Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by a sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or oliguria, and classified by stage and cause. This type of injury occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients, with major complications including volume overload, electrolyte disorders, uremic complications, and drug toxicity. Management includes specific treatments according to the underlying cause and supportive treatment to prevent and manage complications. Kidney replacement therapy is used when complications cannot be managed with medical therapy alone. Despite advances in care, the mortality rate in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy remains approximately 50%."
1,"Acute kidney injury from sepsis: current concepts, epidemiology, pathophysiology, prevention and treatment.","Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is a frequent complication of the critically ill patient and is associated with unacceptable morbidity and mortality. Prevention of S-AKI is difficult because by the time patients seek medical attention, most have already developed acute kidney injury. Thus, early recognition is crucial to provide supportive treatment and limit further insults. Current diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury has limited early detection; however, novel biomarkers of kidney stress and damage have been recently validated for risk prediction and early diagnosis of acute kidney injury in the setting of sepsis. Recent evidence shows that microvascular dysfunction, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming are 3 fundamental mechanisms that may play a role in the development of S-AKI. However, more mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the convoluted pathophysiology of S-AKI and to translate these findings into potential treatment strategies and add to the promising pharmacologic approaches being developed and tested in clinical trials."
2,Acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney's excretory function and is typically diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output, or both. It is the clinical manifestation of several disorders that affect the kidney acutely. Acute kidney injury is common in hospital patients and very common in critically ill patients. In these patients, it is most often secondary to extrarenal events. How such events cause acute kidney injury is controversial. No specific therapies have emerged that can attenuate acute kidney injury or expedite recovery; thus, treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques (eg, renal biomarkers) might help with early diagnosis. Patients are given renal replacement therapy if acute kidney injury is severe and biochemical or volume-related, or if uraemic-toxaemia-related complications are of concern. If patients survive their illness and do not have premorbid chronic kidney disease, they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had acute kidney injury are at increased risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease."
3,Acute kidney injury: current concepts and new insights.,"Background: Acute kidney injury, which was previously named as acute renal failure, is a complex clinical disorder and continues to be associated with poor outcomes. It is frequently seen in hospitalized patients, especially in critically ill patients. The primary causes of acute kidney injury are divided into three categories: prerenal, intrinsic renal and postrenal. The definition and staging of acute kidney injury are mainly based on the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria and the acute kidney injury network (AKIN) criteria, which have previously been defined. However the clinical utility of these criteria is still uncertain. Several biomarkers such as Cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin have been suggested for the diagnosis, severity classification and most importantly, the modification of outcome in acute kidney injury. Methods: Current literature on the definition, biomarkers, management and epidemiology of acute kidney injury was reviewed by searching keywords in Medline and PubMed databases. Results: The epidemiology, pathophysiology and diagnosis of acute kidney injury were discussed. The clinical implications of novel biomarkers and management of acute kidney injury were also discussed. Conclusions: The current definitions of acute kidney injury are based on the RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO criteria. Although these criteria have been widely validated, some of limitations are still remain. Since acute kidney injury is common and harmful, all preventive measures should be taken to avoid its occurrence. Currently, there is no a definitive role for novel biomarkers."
4,Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) most commonly occurs in the hospital setting, and hospital-acquired AKI accounts for 22% of all AKI cases worldwide. AKI causes 2 million deaths per year, and 50% of critically ill patients develop AKI. AKIs include prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal causes. Treatments include renal replacement therapies and correcting reversible causes. Management of these patients includes medical and social history, laboratory studies, tests such as renal biopsy and ultrasonography, vital signs, volume status, and identifying risk factors. Thus, it is essential to identify high-risk patients, correct any reversible causes, prevent further kidney injury, and perform supportive therapy."

6,Acute Kidney Injury and Sepsis.,"Background: Worldwide, both acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis are significant clinical complications, particularly in critical care patients. Sepsis is an important cause of AKI, and AKI is a common complication of sepsis. Methods: We reviewed the literature, including current practice guidelines, on sepsis-associated AKI. Results: We assessed causes of renal failure, potential mechanisms of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury, current practice guidelines, diagnostic criteria and methods, prevention strategies, treatment options, and outcomes. Conclusion: In patients with sepsis-associated AKI, appropriate fluid resuscitation and maintenance of blood pressure are important to prevent further kidney damage. Despite multiple clinical trials, the mechanisms of sepsis-associated AKI and the best treatment options remain unclear."
7,Acute Kidney Injury in Children.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become one of the more common complications seen among hospitalized children. The development of a consensus definition has helped refine the epidemiology of pediatric AKI, and we now have a far better understanding of its incidence, risk factors, and outcomes. Strategies for diagnosing AKI have extended beyond serum creatinine, and the most current data underscore the diagnostic importance of oliguria as well as introduce the concept of urinary biomarkers of kidney injury. As AKI has become more widespread, we have seen that it is associated with a number of adverse consequences including longer lengths of stay and greater mortality. Though effective treatments do not currently exist for AKI once it develops, we hope that the diagnostic and definitional strides seen recently translate to the testing and development of more effective interventions."
8,Perioperative Acute Kidney Injury.,"Perioperative organ injury is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality of surgical patients. Among different types of perioperative organ injury, acute kidney injury occurs particularly frequently and has an exceptionally detrimental effect on surgical outcomes. Currently, acute kidney injury is most commonly diagnosed by assessing increases in serum creatinine concentration or decreased urine output. Recently, novel biomarkers have become a focus of translational research for improving timely detection and prognosis for acute kidney injury. However, specificity and timing of biomarker release continue to present challenges to their integration into existing diagnostic regimens. Despite many clinical trials using various pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions, reliable means to prevent or reverse acute kidney injury are still lacking. Nevertheless, several recent randomized multicenter trials provide new insights into renal replacement strategies, composition of intravenous fluid replacement, goal-directed fluid therapy, or remote ischemic preconditioning in their impact on perioperative acute kidney injury. This review provides an update on the latest progress toward the understanding of disease mechanism, diagnosis, and managing perioperative acute kidney injury, as well as highlights areas of ongoing research efforts for preventing and treating acute kidney injury in surgical patients."
9,Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiology in pediatrics.,"We performed a search in the MEDLINE database using the MeSH term: ""Acute Kidney Injury"", selecting the subtopic ""Epidemiology"", and applying age and year of publication filters. We also searched for the terms: ""acute renal failure"" and ""epidemiology"" ""acute tubular necrosis"" and ""epidemiology"" in the title and summary fields with the same filters. In a second search, we searched in the LILACS database, with the terms: ""acute renal injury"", or ""acute renal failure"" or ""acute kidney injury"" and the age filter. All abstracts were evaluated by the authors and the articles considered most relevant, were examined in their entirety. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) -related mortality ranged from 3-63% in the studies included in this review. AKI etiology has marked regional differences, with sepsis being the main cause in developed countries. In developing countries, primary renal diseases and hypovolemia are still a common cause of AKI."
